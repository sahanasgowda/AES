Each purpose has different techniques.\\nPart ofEnglishWriting skills\\nAdd to My Bitesize\\nRevise\\nvideo\\nVideo\\nquiz\\nTest\\nprevious\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nnext\\nThe persuader's toolkit\\nWhenever you are planning to write persuasively, always think carefully about some of the techniques that you could use to persuade your readers. Below is a checklist of tools, they are similar to the 'writing to argue techniques' but focus on persuasion.\\nYou don’t need to use all of them but you should definitely use a range.\\nAnecdotes - these are short accounts of a real event told in the form of a very brief story. Their effect is often to create an emotional or sympathetic response. An anecdote is usually used to help support a persuasive argument that the writer is putting forward. For example, if a writer wants to persuade people to stop smoking, they may use an anecdote about a close relative who died of lung cancer. For English work at school and in exams, you will need to make up an anecdote to suit the exam question, but it must always be realistic.\\nCatchy phrases or slogans - these will be words that are designed to stick in the readers mind. This will work in the same way as songs or radio adverts, by reminding the reader of the product and by making it easier to remember key information. You can also repeat these through your writing.\\nChatty style - this is language closer in style to that used with friends in conversation. Although writing is always more formal than speech, some uses of a more chatty style can be effective in some genres and for some audiences. It works to create a friendly persuasive effect.\\nList of three/a tripartite list - this is a triple repetition that adds emphasis, for example, 'it’s great; it’s brilliant; it’s amazing!'. A greater effect can be achieved if the words are made more emotional or stronger as the list builds up. No one knows quite why three is a magic number for lists like this, but it is – and is stronger than a list of two or four items, for example. A list of three can help emphasise the benefits of a product or strengthen a point of view impressively but, as always, needs to be used only when it suits to the form of the text (ie its genre) and the needs of the target audience.\\nContrasts - this is a comparison of two things intended to highlight one of them because of the contrast. By showing the different viewpoints, the writer is showing that they are fair and this makes them a more reliable source of information. The reader will see the writer as balanced, honest and trustworthy.\\nCriticising the opposite opinion/the opposition - this is where a writer will mention all of the alternative arguments or the alternative products and explain their downfalls. By doing this, the writer is showing that they are aware of what the reader could be thinking and is making sure that they know all of the negative things about the opposition. It also makes the writer seem as if they are knowledgeable and so what they are saying is important.\\nEmotive words - these are words that are deliberately designed to make a reader have strong feelings. These can be positive or negative. Human beings will react to some words very positively. Words like love, happiness, wealth and good health make us feel good. Other words, such as death, illness, poverty and tears can make us feel very negative. Writers are very clever with the words that they use in order to persuade us of their argument.\\nEmotive pictures - these do not have to be actual pictures. They may be a description of a picture. A detailed description of a picture can put an image in the mind of the reader. An emotive picture will either be one that is really happy or really unhappy. It will depend on what the writer is trying to achieve. Trying to get the reader to picture a sad scene or happy scene is the writer’s way of making the reader feel good about being on their side or bad if they are not.\\nExaggeration (also known as hyperbole) - this is where a writer will be really over the top, in order to make it seem as if an issue is massive, for example, 'how will you ever live with yourself if you ignore this?'. The writer does this intentionally to make the reader consider the enormity of the issue. The exaggeration will usually be a common type of phrase so that the reader is used to hearing it, such as 'millions of us need this'. By using a common phrase, the reader doesn’t question it and will believe the writer.\\nForceful phrases (also known as imperatives) - these will be using words like, ‘think about the plight of...’ or ‘forget your previous ideas about...’. These are used to push a reader into thinking that the need to agree or is urgent. It suggests that this is something that the reader must act upon.\\nHumour - this is where the writer tries to make funny points, maybe even ridiculous ones to prove that they are right. Humour works in two ways. The reader will usually appreciate humour, so it will make them more likely to be on the side of the writer. Also, the reader will remember what made them laugh, so it will make the message in the text even more memorable.\\nImagery - this covers all of the descriptive writing techniques – such as metaphors and similes. These will usually be used in emotive pictures or anecdotes. When a writer uses imagery, they will be trying to get the reader to picture something specific. When you analyse this, think about what the writer is trying to show the reader and how this helps their argument.\\nOpinion as fact - this is where the writer will state that their opinion is fact, when it is actually an opinion. For example, 'It is a fact that I cannot stand winter!'. By stating that opinion is fact, it can be quite confusing for a reader. The reader may feel automatically that it is a fact and could be convinced by it.\\nPersonal pronouns - this is where the writer will use words such as, ’I’ or ’we’ or ’you’ to talk directly to the reader. By using the word, ’you’ and addressing the reader, the writer can appeal directly to every individual reading the text. By using the word ’we’ it will make it seem as if the writer is on the exact side of the reader, as if ’we’ are all in this together.\\nRepetition - this is where a single word or phrase is repeated over and over again in order to emphasise it. Repetition works in a similar way to a list of three. By continually repeating the same idea or phrase, it draws attention to that particular phrase and emphasises its importance. For that reason, it is important to analyse the actual word or point being made and why it needs to be emphasised.\\nRhetorical questions - these are questions that appear in writing that isn’t dialogue. As there is nobody to answer the question, they are usually designed to talk to the reader. It allows the reader a moment to pause and think about the question. For that reason, rhetorical questions are effective in hooking a reader’s interest and making them think about their own response to the question in hand.\\nShock tactics - this is where the writer will try to use shocking imagery or statements in order surprise or horrify the reader. This is effective because it will shock the reader into action. If the reader is surprised or horrified by something, they will remember it and it is likely to cause an emotional response that will make them react.\\nStatistics (and facts) - statistics are numbers or facts that are used to provide convincing information. A writer will use these as a tool to convince the reader. The reader will feel that they cannot argue with facts and that statistics will prove what the writer is saying. They are used to convince a reader and to add factual weight to an argument.\\nQuotations and expert opinions - quotations are used when a writer brings in some information from another person, sometimes an expert, or from another article and ’quotes’ what is said by someone else. By using quotations from other people to back up what is being said or promoted, it will make the argument seem much more appealing. If other people, particularly experts, believe in something, this is used to convince the reader that it must be right.\\nprevious\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nnext\\nMore Guides\\nSentences\\nnext\\nStructure and paragraphs\\nnext\\nTone and style\\nnext\\nFormal and informal\\nnext\\nPreparing and drafting\\nnext\\nWriting to inform and explain\\nnext\\nWriting to describe\\nnext\\nWriting to persuade, argue and advise\\nWriting to review and comment\\nnext\\nWriting to analyse\\nnext\\nCreative and narrative writing\\nnext\\nStruggling to get your head round revision or exams?\\nOur tips from experts and exam survivors will help you through.\\nGet advice here\\nLinks\\nSkillswise: English\\nBBC Scotland: Pinball\\nBBC News: School Report\\nexternal-linkTeachitSUBSCRIPTION\\nexternal-linkTwinkl\\nexternal-linkEdufind: English grammar\\nexternal-linkHeadsqueeze\\nexternal-linkEducation Quizzes: EnglishSUBSCRIPTION\\nKS3 Subjects\\nArt and Design\\nBiology\\nChemistry\\nCitizenship (Wales)\\nComputer Science\\nDesign and Technology\\nEnglish\\nFrench\\nGeography\\nGerman\\nHistory\\nHistory (Environment and society)\\nHumanities - Geography (Wales)\\nICT\\nIrish – Learners\\nLearning for Life and Work\\nMandarin\\nMaths\\nMedia Studies\\nModern Foreign Languages\\nMusic\\nPhysical Education\\nPhysics\\nPSHE and Citizenship\\nReligious Studies\\nScience\\nSpanish\\nWelsh Second Language\\nExplore the BBC\\nHome\\nNews\\nSport\\nReel\\nWorklife\\nTravel\\nFuture\\nCulture\\nMusic\\nTV\\nWeather\\nSounds\\nTerms of Use\\nAbout the BBC\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookies\\nAccessibility Help\\nParental Guidance\\nContact the BBC\\nGet Personalised Newsletters\\nAdvertise with us\\nAdChoices / Do Not Sell My Info\\nCopyright © 2021 BBC.

In addition, letters to the editor and op-eds are a way of reaching a much wider audience with your messages about the healthy development of infants and toddlers and how policy can positively impact babies, toddlers and their families.\\nState legislators and federal lawmakers regularly read the opinion pages of newspapers for clues about issues of concern in their community.\\nWriting opinion pieces are fairly simple and an effective way for you to Be a Voice for Little Kids\\uf0e4 in your community! This ZERO TO THREE Policy Network advocacy tool provides you with some suggestions for writing letters to the editor and op-eds and getting them printed. Download the full article for more details about these strategies and a few examples of opinion pieces that were published, so you can get a sense for how to put the strategies into practice.\\nLetter to the Editor Strategies\\nCheck the newspaper’s print guidelines\\nMost newspapers have a web site. Check the paper’s web site or the editorial page of the print version for information about submitting a letter to the editor. Some newspapers have an online submission form which you can use.\\nKeep it brief and to the point\\nLetters should be concise – typically newspapers have a word limit of about 250 words (about 3 paragraphs). Editors are less likely to print long letters.\\nMake your letter timely\\nTie the subject of your letter to a recent article, editorial or column. Use that article as a hook for communicating your message. Small-circulation newspapers usually print many of the letters they receive. It is more challenging to get a letter printed in a major metropolitan newspaper, so don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t get printed.\\nLocalize your letter\\nExplain how infants and toddlers in your community will be affected. Lend credibility to your letter by noting your professional experiences in the community that prompted you to write on this topic.\\nUse “levels of thought” as a method for organizing your letter\\nThe FrameWorks Institute, a non-profit communications research organization, “adopts the position… that people reason on the basis of deeply-held moral values…” Those moral values are part of a hierarchical process for how people think about ideas and issues, which they refer to as “levels of thought.” You can use levels of thought to structure your letter to the editor. Begin your letter with a big idea or value (level one) that provides a context for understanding the more specific details (levels two and three) of your communication.\\nFor example, The Early Head Start program has made it a priority to provide the best start in life for all its babies and toddlers, so that their children will grow up to be good citizens of the community. The Early Head Start program offers an array of services to pregnant women, infants, toddlers and their families, including home visitation, parent support, early learning and access to medical, mental health and early intervention services. But this community program cannot succeed without adequate federal support for Early Head Start. Reauthorization of Early Head Start is right around the corner. It’s time to remind our federal policymakers that babies in Fillmont, Indiana and across the country depend on them.\\nBe mindful of the tone of your letter\\nThe tone of your letter can either support or overpower the substance of the message you are trying to communicate. Therefore, choosing and controlling tone2 is an important element of your communication.\\nWrite about good news, not just bad\\nThank the paper (when appropriate) for its positive and accurate coverage of an infant-toddler issue. Or thank a policymaker for being a champion for infants and toddlers in the state or community.\\nInclude your name, title, address and daytime phone number\\nEditors like to confirm that the letter was actually written by the person whose name is on it. Also be sure to provide your professional title and affiliation, as it lends credibility to your letter.\\nConsider other newspapers for publication\\nMany metropolitan areas have free weekly community newspapers that go to thousands of homes. Many cities also have newspapers for specific ethnic groups. Consider sending your letter to the editors of these other widely-read publications.\\nMail a copy of your published letter to your state legislators and members of Congress\\nPolicymakers subscribe to local newspapers in their districts. You can continue to build your relationship with them by sending copies of your letter.\\nView a Sample Letter\\nOpinion Editorial Strategies\\nFocus your message on one key point\\nAlthough there may be many elements to the infant-toddler issue you want to address, you will have more success if your editorial is focused and easy to understand.\\nKeep it short\\nTypically newspapers will accept op-eds of 500-800 words. Magazines may accept slightly larger pieces, but check the publication’s requirements before you submit your column.\\nTell the readers upfront why they should care\\nGive voice to the babies that aren’t often heard by telling readers why they should care.\\nOffer specific recommendations\\n“An op-ed is not a news story that simply describes a situation; it is your opinion about how to improve matters.” Make your call to action something concrete and realistic.\\nMake your op-ed timely\\nEditors will be looking for op-ed columns that are compelling and which engage readers in the public debate about a timely issue.\\nReview the opinion pages\\nBy reading the opinion pages, you can get a sense of what is being covered and what is not being addressed. You can also get an idea of the types of op-eds that the editor publishes.\\nView a Sample OpEd\\nSample of a Published Letter to the Editor\\nThis letter was published in the Washington Post, November 6, 2016.\\nTo the Editor:\\nThe Nov. 1 Health & Science article “Help is scarce for troubled youth”\\noffsite link\\ndiscussed the shortage of child psychiatrists, which is leading to a critical lack of access to mental health care for adolescents. Even before adolescence, however, the need for mental health intervention exists and access to services for our youngest children is dire.\\nInfants and very young toddlers deal with issues that can often manifest in dysfunction or illness even before preschool, when expulsion rates are more than three times the expulsion rate of students in Kindergarten through 12th grade. The brains of babies and young toddlers are developing rapidly, forming the architecture for future learning and progress. If they are exposed to unrelenting trauma, fear or stress, it can result in challenges that are harder to address down the road. Taking up comprehensive mental health reform for the young — already passed through the House and on the Senate’s plate right now — is something Congress can and should come together to do now.\\nMatthew E. Melmed, Executive Director ZERO TO THREE, Washington, D.C.\\nSample of a Published OpEd\\nThis Sample Opinion Editorial, published in the New Haven Register, May 7, 2015.\\nThere is growing evidence that early childhood interventions work, and they also represent an excellent return on investment. This statement, made by Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, in a recent congressional budget hearing, is backed by extensive evidence. But the reality is that too many babies, in Connecticut and across the country, are falling behind developmentally even before their second birthday.\\nWe recently had the chance to reinforce these points in testimony to DeLauro and her colleagues on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. If this country is to remain globally competitive, we argue, there is no greater return than an investment in our youngest assets — our children. More specifically, our babies.\\nBabies are born with an amazing capacity to learn. During these early years, neurons are being connected at a rate that far surpasses any other age period. It is during this time that the basic brain architecture is being formed.\\nUnfortunately, too many babies live in circumstances that undermine their chance for healthy development. Here in Connecticut, 52 percent of children under the age of 3 experience at least one risk factor — poverty, residential mobility, unemployed parents, among others. Our prosperous state looks better than the country as a whole, with 35 percent of Connecticut’s children under age 3 living in low-income families, as compared with 47 percent nationally. But that prosperity masks shocking pockets of poverty where many young children live in great deprivation. In Hartford, half of all young children live in poverty — $24,250 for a family of four — and one in five lives in deep poverty (roughly $12,000 for that family of four). Statistically, these children face steep odds to reach their potential, and we as a state and a nation have much to lose if they don’t.\\nIf we are going to turn around the outlook for these children and our nation, we have to get beyond seeing the risks they face and focus on developing their enormous potential. That means making investments now in programs and services that are proven performers.\\nOne such proven performer is home visiting for young children and families. These dual generational programs have shown a range of benefits — from improving children’s health and school readiness to enhancing parents’ ability to support their children’s development to improving family economic self-sufficiency. For every dollar invested in home visiting, the public realizes a savings of $1.80 up to $9.50.\\nA rigorous evaluation conducted at Yale University, for example, found that participation in one Connecticut home visiting model, Minding the Baby, was directly responsible for higher rates of on-time pediatric immunization, significantly lower rates of rapid pregnancy, better parent-child interactions and attachments, and significantly lower rates of child protection referrals for neglect or abuse.\\nEarly Head Start, which serves families and children prenatally to age 3, is another proven performer here in Connecticut and across the country. A rigorous national evaluation of Early Head Start found significant impacts in language skills, social skills and interactions, and behavior. In addition, parents have been more engaged with their children, are more likely to read to them, and display more appropriate and safe disciplinary practices. Many of these positive outcomes continue into school entry and beyond.\\nIn fact, research following children who participated in high quality early care and learning services from infancy to school entry shows the positive benefits reverberating well into adulthood in the form of educational attainment and fewer chronic health problems.\\nIf we focus on developing the potential these children represent, we can change these outcomes and yield productive students and adults. To provide all children with the supports they need to thrive and succeed, we must ensure that investments are made in the youngest children as early as possible through high-quality early care and education programs. Doing so will significantly decrease the school readiness gap, place children on a positive educational trajectory, and provide a sizable return on our national public investment. The old adage “you only get out what you put in” rings true. Let’s ensure this next generation of innovators, thinkers and contributors have all they need to succeed when they need it the most: on day one.\\nWALTER GILLIAM, New Haven, CT and MATTHEW MELMED, Washington, D.C.\\nDr. Walter Gilliam directs The Edward Zigler Center at Yale University and is a board member of ZERO TO THREE.

The activities and tasks outlined below, in which students craft a letter to a local newspaper, allow them to make connections across texts and to their own lives in order to develop their persuasive writing skills and voices. \\nThis GCSE supplement is not a lesson, and does not need to be taught as such. It is structured in such a way as to ensure that the various steps necessary for writing an effective persuasive letter are outlined in an appropriate order: \\nEngage with a stimulus (most of this step was completed in Lesson 21: What Lessons Can We Learn?)\\nDevelop claims and content\\nRead a model letter\\nPlan and write the letter\\nRespond to feedback and redraft\\nYou may decide that your class do not need to follow all of the steps, or that you want your students to do some of the steps in class and others at home. Engage with the supplement in the way that works for your classroom context, adapting it to your students’ needs as you see fit. \\nThis GCSE supplement builds on the work done in Lesson 21: What Lessons Can We Learn?, in which students discussed the unit’s essential question: What can J. B. Priestley’s An Inspector Calls teach us about the impact of our individual and collective decisions and actions on others? Students considered the lessons that they learnt from reading the play, sharing their ideas in a people’s assembly. Now, students will be reflecting on these lessons and developing their ideas into a formal letter about how we can turn our society into a caring community, one in which people consider the needs of others. \\nAlignment with the GCSE Specification\\nClear and Coherent Writing (Lit-AO4, Lang-AO5/AO6)\\nKnowledge of Subject Terminology (Lit-AO2, Lang-AO2)\\nWriting for Impact (form, audience, purpose) (Lang-AO5)\\nStudents generate ideas for their persuasive letter, in which they must write for impact, considering the form, audience and purpose. Before starting their letter, students have the opportunity to review subject terminology linked to persuasive literary devices, if needed. The model and planning aid helps students write clearly and coherently: they are given inspiration for sentence starters and see how to structure their piece. Finally, if teachers are using Marking Criteria Codes to give feedback and give students the opportunity to engage with this feedback and redraft their work, then students will make great progress as writers: they can improve the structure and content of their writing, whilst also enhancing their spelling, punctuation and grammar skills. \\n\\nLearn more about this unit’s Alignment with GCSE Specification. \\nNotes to Teachers\\nWriting for Purpose\\nIn this supplement, students are required to write a letter to a local newspaper to outline how we can turn our society into a caring community, one in which people consider the needs of others. To improve students’ engagement and to encourage them to take the letter seriously, it would be particularly powerful if they were then able to send these letters to their local newspaper. For these reasons and because it is important for students to engage in real-world writing tasks for audiences beyond their teachers and peers, you may wish to give students the addresses of one or more local newspapers. Not only is this an effective way for students to become local upstanders, it is also a means of them putting English skills into practice beyond the world of school. It will also encourage students to engage with the marking and redrafting of their work, which is a vital way of supporting their development as writers.\\nModel Letters\\nThere are two examples of persuasive letters contained within the Persuasive Letter Examples handout. Please select the appropriate handout for your students so they can access the content at a level appropriate for them. Or you may choose to use both intermediate and advanced models in the same class so that your students can examine the ‘writing moves’ that each author makes when crafting their letters. Alternatively, you could group students according to level and have them read the models aloud or ask students to read the models independently.\\nMarking Criteria Codes\\nWe recommend that teachers use Marking Criteria Codes when reviewing students’ written work to help them develop the structure and content of their writing, and their written English. These marking criteria codes enable teachers to nurture their students as effective writers by giving them in-depth feedback, which requires proactive student engagement.\\nMaterials\\nHandout: Persuasive Techniques Word Match\\nHandout: Persuasive Writing Planning Chart – Claim Development\\nHandout: Persuasive Letter Writing Examples \\nHandout: Persuasive Letter Planning Aid\\nTeaching Strategies\\nRead Aloud\\nThink, Pair, Share\\nMarking Criteria Codes \\nSuggested Activities and Steps\\nStep One: Engage with a Stimulus\\nDiscuss Social Duty\\nInform students that they will be reflecting on the notion of duty, looking at how it is described in the play and thinking about the notion of duty to society and to others. \\nProject the following quotations concerning duty from the play on the board:\\n‘It’s my duty to ask questions’ (Inspector, p. 15)\\nWell, it’s my duty to keep labour costs down’ (Mr Birling, p. 15)\\nAsk students to discuss the following questions in groups: \\nWhat is meant by ‘duty’ in these two quotations?\\nWhen, if ever, can the idea of duty be problematic?\\nWhat duties do you think people have to others and to society? \\nHow has reading An Inspector Calls made you more aware of your social duties?\\nStep Two: Develop Claims and Content\\nInform students that they will be preparing to write a persuasive letter to a local newspaper that outlines how we can build a society in which people consider the needs of others. If it is useful for your students to recap their knowledge of persuasive writing techniques, give them the Persuasive Techniques Word Match handout.\\nAsk students to respond to the following questions in pairs, noting down their ideas to share with the class:\\nWhy is having a society that considers the needs of everyone important? \\nHow can we build a society that gives all people the support they need? Make a list in your books of specific actions.\\nInvite students to share their ideas with the class, collecting what they say on the board or large paper so that all students have this to refer to. You may want to collect this in the form of a two column chart, titling one column ‘Importance of having a society that considers the needs of all’ and the other ‘Ideas on how to build a society that gives all people the support they need’.\\nNext, explain to students that to write an effective letter, they need to ensure that all of the claims that they use are well developed and link to the statement, which in this case is: We can turn our society into a caring community, in which people consider the needs of others. They should support this argument by thinking of relevant claims, and thinking about how they can develop these claims with supporting ideas. \\nTo help them with this process, give your students the Persuasive Writing Planning Chart – Claim Development handout and project the example on the board or model your own, explicitly outlining your thinking.\\nTopic Statement: We can turn our society into a caring community, in which people consider the needs of others\\nClaim One Supporting Idea Persuasive Device Supporting Idea Persuasive Device\\nWe need to connect groups of people from all levels of society, giving them the chance to interact and communicate. Connecting people with those who are from different social backgrounds can help make people more aware of others’ needs.\\nWealthy people with power might be more likely to campaign on behalf of those who have fewer opportunities.\\nAssertion: People are kind and like to help each other out.  \\n\\nRhetorical question: People will ask themselves how can I help? What can I do to improve their situation?\\nConnecting people with different life experiences can help prevent future conflict as people will meet and learn from those who have different life experiences to their own.\\nImperative & Repetition: Imagine what we can learn from each other. Imagine the barriers we can overcome.  \\n\\nFirst-person plural pronouns (inclusive): We are members of society: our lives are and will always be interconnected.\\nThis table is best viewed on a desktop computer. If viewing on a mobile device, it's recommended to do so in landscape position.\\nEncourage your students to generate ideas by thinking about what they learnt about the individual and society, and social responsibility from studying An Inspector Calls. It is also worth explaining to them that they can be creative with their ideas, providing their ideas are realistic and relevant to the central argument of the letter. They may also wish to outline ways that the newspaper could help, if relevant (e.g. the newspaper could set up a mentoring programme that pairs people from different walks of life as letter writing partners).\\nIf helpful, you can give your students one or more of the following claims or brainstorm potential claims as a class on the board, but it is best if students first try to do the work of generating their own claims that are relevant to them and that they are interested in writing about:\\nStudents should be taught about social responsibility in schools.\\nEmpty buildings should be turned into hostels for the homeless.\\nPeople should knock on doors to meet their neighbours.\\nSchools should host community events.\\nStep Three: Read a Model Letter\\nOnce your students have completed one or two claim rows on the Persuasive Writing Planning Chart – Claim Development, hand out one of the model Persuasive Letter Writing Examples, choosing the right model for your students’ level (see Notes to Teachers, above).\\nDepending on the models you use, you can read out the letter as a class using one of the read aloud strategies, group students together according to ability, or ask students to read the letter independently.\\nOnce students have read the letter, give them time to reread it independently and annotate its content. You may wish to give them the following questions to focus their annotation: \\nCircle or underline persuasive writing techniques\\nCircle or underline claims the author uses\\nCircle or underline the evidence the author uses to support their claims\\nWhat do you notice about the supporting ideas? How many are there?\\nHow does the writer link their ideas together? \\nPut a question mark by ideas you don’t understand or find puzzling\\nGive the students ten minutes to discuss their annotations with a partner using the Think, Pair, Share strategy and then invite some students to share their ideas or any queries they have with the class. \\nInvite students to revisit their Persuasive Writing Planning Chart – Claim Development and add any additional ideas that have come to mind since reading the letter example.\\nStep Four: Plan and Write the Letter\\nFinally, give students the Persuasive Letter Planning Aid handout and ask them to use it to first plan, and then write a letter to the local newspaper outlining how we can turn our society into a caring community, in which people consider the needs of others. \\nTo help them with the planning process, you may wish to project this structure on the board: \\nOpening paragraph: outline why you are writing – refer to the topic statement\\nParagraph one: claim one + two supporting ideas (each with two persuasive devices)\\nParagraph two: claim two + two supporting ideas (each with two persuasive devices)\\nParagraph three: claim three + two supporting ideas (each with two persuasive devices)\\nClosing paragraph: summary of message and call to action\\nStep Five: Respond to Feedback and Redraft\\nWhen students give you back their letters, consider using the Marking Criteria Codes teaching strategy to give in-depth feedback and to boost student engagement with marking.\\nThen, give students an opportunity to redraft their work, taking on board the suggested improvements. To make this GCSE writing task a real-world assignment, have students revise their letters and submit them to a local newspaper to be considered for publication.\\nPREVIOUS LESSON\\nNEXT LESSON\\nAlignment with GCSE Specification\\nRead about how this unit is aligned with Ofqual’s subject aims and learning outcomes for both the English Literature and English Language GCSEs.\\nUnit\\nRETURN TO UNIT: Teaching An Inspector Calls\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nINTRODUCTION\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nGet Prepared to Teach this Scheme of Work in Your Classroom\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 1 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nBuilding a Classroom Community\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 2 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nExploring Where I'm From\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 3 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nExploring Social Inequality\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 4 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nPriestley's World and the World of the Play\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 5 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nThe Treatment of Edwardian Women\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 6 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nEntering the World of the Play\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 7 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nUnderstanding Class\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 8 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nDeveloping Character Inferences\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 9 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nUnderstanding Mr Birling\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 10 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nThe Cost of Labour\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nGCSE SUPPLEMENT\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nPersuasive Writing: A Letter to Parliament\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 11 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nUnderstanding Sheila\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 12 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAct One Review\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 13 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nDiffering Perspectives and Conflict\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 14 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAnalysing Gerald’s Character\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 15 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nUnderstanding Mrs Birling\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nGCSE SUPPLEMENT\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAnalytical Writing: A Character Paragraph\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 16 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nEric's Decisions and Consent\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nGCSE SUPPLEMENT\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nPersuasive Writing: A Speech about Consent\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 17 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nInspecting Inspector Goole\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 18 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nSocial Systems and Individual Agency\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 19 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nPutting the Characters on Trial\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 20 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nBearing Witness to Eva Smith\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nGCSE SUPPLEMENT\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAnalytical Writing: The GCSE Character Essay\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 21 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nWhat Lessons Can We Learn?\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nGCSE SUPPLEMENT\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nPersuasive Writing: A Letter to a Newspaper for a Caring Community\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 22 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nRecurring Themes in the Play\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nLESSON 23 OF 23\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nTheatre as a Call to Action\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nREQUIREMENTS\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAlignment with Ofsted Requirements\\nAdd or Edit Playlist\\nREQUIREMENTS\\nDemocracy & Civic Engagement\\nAlignment with the GCSE Specification\\nDownload Free Sample\\nSubscribe to Our Blog\\nFind a Workshop or Seminar\\nSearch Our Global Collection\\nEverything you need to get started teaching your students about racism, antisemitism and prejudice.\\nStay Connected With Us\\nSign up for email updates.\\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\nFollow Us:\\n@FacingHistory on Twitter Facing History and Ourselves on Facebook Facing History on Instagram\\nAbout Us Topics Educator Resources Professional Development\\nOur Blogs Calendar Careers Books & Borrowing Give\\nCopyright © 2021 Facing History and Ourselves.

Stores and libraries have very different missions, and very different reasons for having the items they do on the shelves. Stores are in the business of making money, and probably will not stock items that are likely to offend a majority of their customers. Libraries are in the business of supporting all members of their community, and have collection development policies to that effect. Patron challenges to the presence of some items will be considered, but in most cases, they will not be removed because they were selected according to the library’s policy.\\n908 viewsView upvotes\\n3\\n3\\nRelated Questions\\nMore Answers Below\\nWhy do people put books on their shelves instead of reading them?\\nWhat are some best book keeping shelves?\\nHow do you keep books in shelves?\\nDo certain faith-based organizations still believe in banning books and censoring certain music?\\nWere the books on the shelves in this scene from \"I\\'m Not There\" chosen by the director (or the screenwriter), or did they simply use the books that happened to be on the shelves in a community church where they happened to film the scene?\\nAnika Livo\\n, works at Public Libraries\\nAnswered 1 year ago · Author has 3K answers and 1.8M answer views\\nWhich shelves?

I say that from the start, because I so often hear the terms incorrectly interchanged.\\nYour memoir will be autobiographical, of course, but it can’t be about you.\\nConfused yet? Stay with me.\\nAutobiography vs. Memoir: What’s the Difference?\\nAn autobiography is your life story from birth to the present.\\nA memoir is theme-oriented with anecdotes from your life that buttress a specific theme.\\nToo many authors write a memoir because they believe their lives are so interesting that even strangers would enjoy a detailed account.\\nDon’t misunderstand, maybe you are interesting.\\nAll of us are, to a degree. I hardly know anyone who doesn’t have a story.\\nBut unless you’re a celebrity, a household name, most people beyond your family and close friends aren’t likely to care.\\nThey care about themselves and what your book offers them.\\nSo your theme must be reader-oriented, offering universally true transferable principles that will help them.\\nThe closest I have come to writing my own memoir, Writing for the Soul, uses selected anecdotes about famous and interesting people I’ve met to illustrate points I make about writing.\\nHad I merely written an autobiography and not offered writing instruction, it would’ve been largely ignored.\\nSo your memoir should draw on anecdotes from your life selected to show how you progressed from some unlikely place to where you are today.\\nIn that way, it’s about you, but it’s for the benefit of the reader.\\nMaybe you’re:\\nFrom the other side of the tracks\\nFrom a broken home\\nA victim of abuse\\nA recovered addict\\nAn orphan\\nYet you have achieved:\\nFinancial security\\nAcceptance\\nHappiness\\nHealth\\nFaith\\nYou might start with how bad things once were for you and how unlikely it was that you would escape your situation.\\nThen you would show pivotal experiences and people important to your transformation, what you learned, and how your life changed.\\nNaturally, the better your stories and the more significant your change (in fiction we call this character arc), the better your memoir.\\nHowever, great stories are not the point — and frankly, neither is the memoirist (you).\\nThe point is reader takeaway.\\nReaders should be able to apply to themselves and their own situations the larger truths and principles your theme imparts.\\nThat way, you don’t have to awkwardly try to apply your message to them. Ideally, they’ll do it for themselves.\\nThey may be enduring something entirely different from what you did, yet your story gives them hope.\\nWhat Publishers Look For\\nDon’t buy into the idea that only famous people can sell a memoir.\\nMemoirs by previous nobodies succeed all the time—and for one reason: they resonate with readers because readers identify with them.\\nTruth, especially the hard, gritty, painful stuff, bears transferable principles.\\nSuch candor attracts readers, and readers are what publishers want.\\nAn astute agent or acquisitions editor recognizes how relatable a memoir will be and takes a chance on one.\\nAgents and editors tell me they love to discover such gems — the same way they love discovering the next great novelist.\\nSo, when writing your memoir…\\nYou may be the subject, but it’s not about you.\\nIt may seem counterintuitive to think reader-first while writing in first-person about yourself, but readers long to be changed by your story.\\nGive them insight about life through your experiences. Give them the tools they need to overcome their own struggles, even if they’re not at all like yours. Give them a model for overcoming.\\nCouch it in entertaining, educational, and emotional stories, and they’ll not only stay with you till the last page, but they’ll also recommend your memoir to their friends.\\nWant to save this guide to read whenever you wish? Click here.\\nHow to Write a Memoir \\nSettle On Your Theme\\nSelect Your Anecdotes\\nOutline Your Book\\nWrite It Like a Novel\\nAvoid Throwing People Under the Bus\\nStep 1. Settle On Your Theme\\nYour unstated theme must be, “You’re not alone. If I overcame this, you can overcome anything.”\\nThat’s what appeals to readers. Even if they do come away from your memoir impressed with you, it won’t be because you’re so special — even if you are. Whether they admit it or not, readers care most about themselves.\\nThey’re reading your memoir wondering, What’s in this for me? The more transferable principles you offer in a story well told, the more successful your book will be.\\nCosmic Commonalities\\nAll people, regardless of age, ethnicity, location, and social status, share certain felt needs: food, shelter, and love. They fear abandonment, loneliness, and the loss of loved ones. Regardless your theme, if it touches on any of those needs and fears, readers can identify.\\nI can read the memoir of someone of my opposite gender, for whom English is not her first language, of a different race and religion, who lives halfway around the world from me — and if she writes of her love for her child or grandchild, it reaches me.\\nKnowing or understanding or relating to nothing else about her, I understand love of family.\\nHow to Write a Memoir Without Preaching\\nTrust your narrative to convey your message. Too many memoirists feel the need to eventually turn the spotlight on the reader with a sort of “So, how about you…?”\\nLet your experiences and how they impacted you make their own points, and trust the reader to get it. Beat him over the head with your theme and you run him off.\\nAvoid being preachy by using what I call the Come Alongside Method. Show what happened to you and what you learned, and if the principles apply to your reader, give him credit for being smart enough to get it.\\nStep 2. Select Your Anecdotes\\nThe best memoirs let readers see themselves in your story so they can identify with your experiences and apply to their own lives the lessons you’ve learned.\\nIf you’re afraid to mine your pain deeply enough to tell the whole truth, you may not be ready to write your memoir. There’s little less helpful — or marketable — than a memoir that glosses over the truth.\\nSo, feature the anecdotes from your life that support your theme, regardless how painful it is to resurrect the memories. The more introspective and vulnerable you are, the more effective your memoir will be.\\nCreate a list of events in your life and their impact on you. These may be major events like a war, your parents’ divorce, a graduation, a wedding, or the loss of a dear friend or relative.\\nBut they may also be seemingly mundane life events that for some reason affected you deeply. Just make sure they support your theme.\\nWho is unforgettable and what role did they play in making you the person you’ve become?\\nInterview family and friends for different perspectives. Peruse photographs, revisit meaningful places, research dates, the weather, and relevant history.\\nStep 3. Outline Your Book\\nWithout a clear vision, trying to write a memoir will likely end in disaster. There’s no substitute for an outline.\\nPotential agents or publishers require in your proposal a synopsis of where you’re going, and they also need to know that you know.\\nOne that changed the course of my writing career is novelist Dean Koontz’s Classic Story Structure, spelled out in his classic How to Write Bestselling Fiction. Though obviously intended as a framework for a novel, I discovered it applies perfectly to almost any genre (including TV sitcoms, if you can believe it).\\nAnd fortunately, for the purposes of my subject today, Koontz’s classic story structure serves a memoir beautifully too.\\nHere it is in a nutshell:\\n1 — Plunge your main character into terrible trouble as soon as possible\\n2 — Everything he does to try to get out of it makes it only progressively worse until…\\n3 — His situation appears hopeless\\n4 — But in the end, because of what he’s learned and how he’s grown through all those setbacks, he rises to the challenge and wins the day.\\nYou might be able to structure your memoir the same way merely by how you choose to tell the story. As I say, don’t force things, but the closer you can get to that structure, the more engaging your memoir will be.\\nFor your memoir, naturally you’re the main character.\\nAnd the Terrible Trouble would be the nadir of your life. (If nadir is a new word for you, it’s the opposite of zenith.)\\nTake the reader with you to your lowest point, and show what you did to try to remedy things.\\nBut what about that “as soon as possible” caveat?\\nMaybe your terrible trouble didn’t manifest itself until later in life.\\nFine, start there. The backstory can emerge as you progress, but you’ll find his structure and sequencing will make for the most compelling read.\\nImportant in fiction as well as in a memoir is to be sure your reader is invested in the main character enough to care when he is plunged into terrible trouble.\\nWhile in fiction that means some hint of the stakes — he’s a husband, a father, has suffered some loss, etc. If that’s also true of you, subtly inject it.\\nAlso in a memoir, you want to promise a good outcome, some form of your own wonder at who you are no compared to who you once were or destined to be. That way readers can take from your story that things can dramatically change for the better in their lives too.\\nOne of the reasons this structure works so well in fiction is because it’s often true in real life.\\nIf you’ve become a successful, happy person despite an unfortunate background, it’s likely that you tried many times to fix things, only to see them deteriorate until you developed the ability to break through.\\nAll Koontz, and I, are saying is to emphasize that.\\nKeep your outline to a single page for now.\\nThen develop a synopsis with a sentence or two of what each chapter will cover.\\nWrite this is present tense. “I enroll in college only to find that…”\\nAnd don’t worry if you’ve forgotten the basics of classic outlining or have never felt comfortable with the concept.\\nIt doesn’t have to be rendered in Roman numerals and capital and lowercase letters and then numerals, unless that serves you best.\\nJust a list of sentences that synopsize your idea works fine too.\\nAnd remember, it’s a fluid document meant to serve you and your book. Play with it, rearrange it as you see fit — even during the writing.\\nStep 4. Write It Like a Novel\\nIt’s as important in a memoir as it is in a novel to show and not just tell.\\nExample:\\nTelling\\nMy father was a drunk who abused my mother and me. I was scared to death every time I heard him come in late at night.\\nShowing\\nAs soon as I heard the gravel crunch beneath the tires, I dove under my bed.\\nI could tell by his footsteps whether Dad was sober and tired or loaded and looking for a fight.\\nI prayed God would magically make me big enough to jump between him and my mom, because she was always his first target…\\nUse every trick in the novelist’s arsenal to make each anecdote come to life: dialogue, description, conflict, tension, pacing, everything.\\nWorry less about chronology than theme.\\nYou’re not married to the autobiographer’s progressive timeline.\\nTell whatever anecdote fits your point for each chapter, regardless where they fall on the calendar.\\nJust make the details clear so the reader knows where you are in the story.\\nYou might begin with the most significant memory of your life, even from childhood.\\nThen you can segue into something like, “Only now do I understand what was really happening.” Your current-day voice can always drop in to tie things together.\\nCharacter Arc\\nAs in a novel, how the protagonist (in this case, you) grows is critical to a successful story. Your memoir should make clear the difference between who you are today and who you once were. What you learn along the way becomes your character arc.\\nPoint of View\\nIt should go without saying that you write a memoir in the first-person. And just as in a novel, the point-of-view character is the one with the problem, the challenge, something he’s after. Tell both your outer (what happens) and your inner (its impact on you) story.\\nSetups and Payoffs\\nGreat novels carry a book-length setup that demands a payoff in the end, plus chapter-length setups and payoffs, and sometimes even the same within scenes. The more of these the better.\\nThe same is true for your memoir. Virtually anything that makes the reader stay with you to find out what happens is a setup that demands a payoff. Even something as seemingly innocuous as your saying that you hoped high school would deliver you from the torment of junior high makes the reader want to find out if that proved true.\\nMake ‘em Wait\\nAvoid using narrative summary to give away too much information too early. I’ve seen memoir manuscripts where the author tells in the first paragraph how they went from abject poverty to independent wealth in 20 years, “…and I want to tell you how that happened.”\\nTo me, that takes the air right out of the tension balloon.\\nMany readers would agree and see no reason to continue reading.\\nBetter to set them up for a payoff and let them wait.\\nNot so long that you lose them to frustration, but long enough to build tension.\\nStep 5. Avoid Throwing People Under the Bus\\nIf you’re brave enough to expose your own weaknesses, foibles, embarrassments, and yes, even your failures to the world, what about your friends, enemies, loved ones, teachers, bosses, and coworkers?\\nIf you tell the truth, are you allowed to throw them under the bus?\\nIn some cases, yes.\\nBut should you?\\nNo.\\nEven if they gave you permission in writing, what’s the upside?\\nUsually a person painted in a negative light — even if the story is true — would not sign a release allowing you to expose them publicly.\\nBut even if they did, would it be the right, ethical, kind thing to do?\\nAll I can tell you is that I wouldn’t do it. And I wouldn’t want it done to me.\\nIf the Golden Rule alone isn’t reason enough not to do it, the risk of being sued certainly ought to be.\\nSo, What to Do?\\nOn one hand, I’m telling you your memoir is worthless without the grit. On the other, I’m telling you not to expose the evildoers.\\nStalemate? No.\\nHere’s the solution:\\nChanging names to protect the guilty is not enough. Too many people in your family and social orbit will know the person, making your writing legally actionable.\\nSo change more than just the name.\\nChange the location. Change the year. Change their gender. You could even change the offense.\\nIf your own father verbally abused you so painfully when you were thirteen that you still suffer from the memory decades later, attribute it to a teacher and have it happen at an entirely different age.\\nIs that lying in a nonfiction book? Not if you include a disclaimer upfront that stipulates: “Some names and details have been changed to protect identities.”\\nSo, no, don’t throw anyone under the bus. But don’t stop that bus!\\nCommon Memoir Mistakes \\nMaking it too much like an autobiography (missing a theme)\\nIncluding minutiae\\nBragging\\nGlossing over the truth\\nPreaching\\nEffecting the wrong tone: funny, sarcastic, condescending\\nHow to Start Your Memoir\\nStart slowly by setting the stage or explaining family dynamics and your reader will soon lose interest.\\nHook your reader from page one by beginning in medias res — in the middle of things. That doesn’t mean it has to be slam-bang action, but something must be happening.\\nMemoir Examples\\nThoroughly immerse yourself in this genre before attempting to write in it. I read nearly 50 memoirs before I wrote mine (Writing for the Soul).

Interactions with people, whether it’s family, friends, or complete strangers, are the construct that make up our life. And yet, we too often move quickly past one interaction to get to the next.\\nAs you become more successful\\u200a—\\u200agrow your family, your relationships, your company, your team\\u200a—\\u200athe number of interactions will only increase. It becomes more tempting to treat a new neighbor like any other person you bump into on the street.\\nHere’s where patience comes in. Take a deep breath. There’s a person on the other end of the conversation. Someone who needs a piece of you. They need the value you bring to this world.\\nYou can make them smile or give them courage.\\nWhether you’re selling something, or being sold something.\\nTelling or being told.\\nTeaching or being taught.\\nCaring or being cared for.\\nNo matter what you’re doing, you have a gift to offer the person in front of you in that very moment. Here’s an example…\\nA Story of Patience.\\nI heard an amazing story of patience the other day. It has stuck with me since, and it’s altered the way I shape my interactions throughout each day.\\nThis is a story about a small, random act of kindness that affected two lives in a big way:\\nA New York City taxi driver arriveS at the final stop for his shift. He honked. After waiting a few minutes, he honked again. Because it was his last stop, he considered pulling away. Instead, he put the car in park and walked up to the door.\\nHe knocked.\\nHe heard an elderly voice, “Just a minute.”\\nHe then heard the shuffling of bags moving across the floor. Then the door opened.\\nIt was a small woman in her 90’s with a soft smile wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it. As she answered, the taxi driver caught a glimpse inside the house. It looked as if no one had lived there for years. All the furniture was covered in sheets, no clocks on the wall, and no knickknacks on the counters.\\n“Could you carry my bag?“ the lady asked.\\nThe cab driver walked her slowly down the steps of the front porch to the cab.\\nOnce in the cab, the lady handed the driver an address and asked, “Could you drive through downtown?”\\n“It’s not the shortest way,” The driver answered.\\n“I’m in no hurry. I don’t mind,” she said. “I’m on my way to hospice…”\\nThe driver and passenger shared a quick glimpse in the rearview mirror, enough for her to see his concern and continue:\\n“I don’t have any family left. The doctor says I don’t have very long.”\\nThe driver quietly reached over and shut off the meter then asked, “What route would you like me to take?”\\nFor the next two hours, they drove through the city. She showed the driver where she once worked, the neighborhood where she and her husband first lived, a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom when she was a girl. There were a few parts of town she asked the driver to slow down and she would sit, staring into the darkness, saying nothing.\\nAfter a couple hours, she suddenly said, “I’m tired. Let’s go now.”\\nThey drove in silence to the address she had given him. When they arrived, two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as they pulled up. They must have been expecting her.\\nThe driver opened the trunk to take out the suitcase. As he shut the trunk, she was already in a wheelchair.\\n“How much do I owe you?” She asked, reaching into her purse.\\n“Nothing,” said the driver.\\n“You have to make a living,” she answered.\\n“There are other passengers,” he responded.\\nAlmost without thinking, the driver bent and gave the lady a hug. She held on tightly.\\n“You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,” she said. “Thank you.”\\nThe driver gave a final squeeze of the lady’s hand and the two turned to go their separate ways. As he got in the car and glanced over to her, the door was shut.\\nHe didn’t pick up any more passengers That night. In fact, he could hardly speak.\\nWhat if that woman had gotten an angry or impatient driver? What if she got someone who refused to get out and go to her door? Refused to take the time driving around the city?\\nThe taxi driver couldn’t shake the feeling that this single moment may be one of the most important moments of his life.\\nTHE CHALLENGE\\nBe patient in conversation.\\nWe can treat our interactions as just that — an interaction — when, in fact, there may be an inportant moment waiting to be discovered.\\nThe woman is not the only one to benefit that day. One could argue that the cab driver got the most from their experience. A life to live with that memory and that feeling of what he did, the significance of the moment, and knowledge of how precious life is. I’m sure all this and more stuck with him every day after.\\nNot every interaction has this level of potential. But we’ll never know unless we try.\\nTake a few moments today to find more patience with the people in your life. This might be listening more intently to your spouse, enjoying a conversation with your kids, taking time to check in with a neighbor, or listening to a coworker’s struggle with something outside of work. Whatever it is, give it your attention.\\nLook for the lesson, the opportunity to give encouragement, or, often the most important, simply be present with that person.

It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled,[1] or from humorous stories or thoughts.[2] Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators[3] as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling.\\nLaughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others. Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback.[4][5][6][7]\\nThe study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology.\\nLaughter\\nA short clip of a woman laughing.\\nProblems playing this file?

It may ensue from jokes, tickling, and other stimuli completely unrelated to psychological state, such as nitrous oxide. One group of researchers speculated that noises from infants as early as 16 days old may be vocal laughing sounds or laughter,[8] however the weight of the evidence supports its appearance at 15 weeks to four months of age.\\nLaughter researcher Robert Provine [es] said: \"Laughter is a mechanism everyone has; laughter is part of universal human vocabulary. There are thousands of languages, hundreds of thousands of dialects, but everyone speaks laughter in pretty much the same way.\" Babies have the ability to laugh before they ever speak. Children who are born blind and deaf still retain the ability to laugh.[9]\\nProvine argues that \"Laughter is primitive, an unconscious vocalization.\" Provine argues that it probably is genetic. In a study of the \"Giggle Twins\", two happy twins who were separated at birth and only reunited 43 years later, Provine reports that \"until they met each other, neither of these exceptionally happy ladies had known anyone who laughed as much as they did.\" They reported this even though they had been brought together by their adoptive parents, who they indicated were \"undemonstrative and dour\". He indicates that the twins \"inherited some aspects of their laugh sound and pattern, readiness to laugh, and maybe even taste in humor\".[10]\\nScientists have noted the similarity in forms of laughter induced by tickling among various primates, which suggests that laughter derives from a common origin among primate species.[11][12]\\nA very rare neurological condition has been observed whereby the sufferer is unable to laugh out loud, a condition known as aphonogelia.[13]\\nBrain[edit]\\nA woman laughing\\nA man laughing\\nNeurophysiology indicates that laughter is linked with the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that produces endorphins.[14] Scientists have shown that parts of the limbic system are involved in laughter. This system is involved in emotions and helps us with functions necessary for humans\\' survival. The structures in the limbic system that are involved in laughter are the hippocampus and the amygdala.[15]\\nThe December 7, 1984, Journal of the American Medical Association describes the neurological causes of laughter as follows:\\n\"Although there is no known \\'laugh center\\' in the brain, its neural mechanism has been the subject of much, albeit inconclusive, speculation. It is evident that its expression depends on neural paths arising in close association with the telencephalic and diencephalic centers concerned with respiration. Wilson considered the mechanism to be in the region of the mesial thalamus, hypothalamus, and subthalamus. Kelly and co-workers, in turn, postulated that the tegmentum near the periaqueductal grey contains the integrating mechanism for emotional expression. Thus, supranuclear pathways, including those from the limbic system that Papez hypothesised to mediate emotional expressions such as laughter, probably come into synaptic relation in the reticular core of the brain stem. So while purely emotional responses such as laughter are mediated by subcortical structures, especially the hypothalamus, and are stereotyped, the cerebral cortex can modulate or suppress them.\"\\nSome drugs are well known for their laughter-facilitating properties (e. g. ethanol and cannabis),[16] while the others, like salvinorin A (the active ingredient of Salvia divinorum), can even induce bursts of uncontrollable laughter.[17]\\nA research article was published December 1, 2000 on the psycho-evolution of laughter (Panksepp 2000).[18]\\nHealth[edit]\\nA link between laughter and healthy function of blood vessels was first reported in 2005 by researchers at the University of Maryland Medical Center with the fact that laughter causes the dilatation of the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, and increases blood flow.[19] Drs. Michael Miller (University of Maryland) and William Fry (Stanford) theorize that beta-endorphin like compounds released by the hypothalamus activate receptors on the endothelial surface to release nitric oxide, thereby resulting in dilation of vessels. Other cardioprotective properties of nitric oxide include reduction of inflammation and decreased platelet aggregation.[20]\\nLaughter has proven beneficial effects on various other aspects of biochemistry. It has been shown to lead to reductions in stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine. When laughing the brain also releases endorphins that can relieve some physical pain.[21] Laughter also boosts the number of antibody-producing cells and enhances the effectiveness of T-cells, leading to a stronger immune system.[22] A 2000 study found that people with heart disease were 40 percent less likely to laugh and be able to recognize humor in a variety of situations, compared to people of the same age without heart disease.[23]\\nAnecdotally, journalist and author Norman Cousins developed in 1964 a treatment program for his ankylosing spondylitis and collagen disease consisting of large doses of Vitamin C alongside laughter induced by comic films, including those of the Marx Brothers. \"I made the joyous discovery that ten minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep,\" he reported. \"When the pain-killing effect of the laughter wore off, we would switch on the motion picture projector again and not infrequently, it would lead to another pain-free interval.\"[24][25]\\nCommunication[edit]\\nA number of studies using methods of conversation analysis and discourse analysis have documented the systematic workings of laughter in a variety of interactions, from casual conversations to interviews, meetings, and therapy sessions.[26] Working with recorded interactions, researchers have created detailed transcripts that indicate not only the presence of laughter but also features of its production and placement.\\nThese studies challenge several widely held assumptions about the nature of laughter. Contrary to notions that it is spontaneous and involuntary, research documents that laughter is sequentially organized and precisely placed relative to surrounding talk. Far more than merely a response to humor, laughter often works to manage delicate and serious moments. More than simply an external behavior “caused” by an inner state, laughter is highly communicative and helps accomplish actions and regulate relationships.[27]\\nCauses[edit]\\nLaughter is a common response to tickling\\nSee also: Theories of humor\\nCommon causes for laughter are sensations of joy and humor; however, other situations may cause laughter as well.\\nA general theory that explains laughter is called the relief theory. Sigmund Freud summarized it in his theory that laughter releases tension and \"psychic energy\". This theory is one of the justifications of the beliefs that laughter is beneficial for one\\'s health.[28] This theory explains why laughter can be used as a coping mechanism when one is upset, angry or sad.\\nPhilosopher John Morreall theorizes that human laughter may have its biological origins as a kind of shared expression of relief at the passing of danger. Friedrich Nietzsche, by contrast, suggested laughter to be a reaction to the sense of existential loneliness and mortality that only humans feel.\\nFor example: a joke creates an inconsistency and the audience automatically tries to understand what the inconsistency means; if they are successful in solving this \\'cognitive riddle\\' and they realize that the surprise was not dangerous, they laugh with relief. Otherwise, if the inconsistency is not resolved, there is no laugh, as Mack Sennett pointed out: \"when the audience is confused, it doesn\\'t laugh.\" This is one of the basic laws of a comedian, referred to as \"exactness\". It is important to note that sometimes the inconsistency may be resolved and there may still be no laugh.[citation needed] Because laughter is a social mechanism, an audience may not feel as if they are in danger, and the laugh may not occur. In addition, the extent of the inconsistency (and aspects of its timing and rhythm) has to do with the amount of danger the audience feels, and how hard or long they laugh.\\nLaughter can also be brought on by tickling. Although most people find it unpleasant, being tickled often causes heavy laughter, thought to be an (often uncontrollable) reflex of the body.[29][30]\\nTwo laughing men by Hans von Aachen, circa 1574\\nStructure and anatomy[edit]\\nA normal laugh has the structure of \"ha-ha-ha\" or \"ho-ho-ho\". It is unnatural, and one is physically unable, to have a laugh structure of \"ha-ho-ha-ho\". The usual variations of a laugh most often occur in the first or final note in a sequence- therefore, \"ho-ha-ha\" or \"ha-ha-ho\" laughs are possible. Normal note durations with unusually long or short \"inter-note intervals\" do not happen due to the result of the limitations of our vocal cords. This basic structure allows one to recognize a laugh despite individual variants.[31]\\nIt has also been determined that eyes moisten during laughter as a reflex from the tear glands.[22]\\nNegative aspects[edit]\\nLaughter is not always a pleasant experience and is associated with several negative phenomena. Excessive laughter can lead to cataplexy, and unpleasant laughter spells, excessive elation, and fits of laughter can all be considered negative aspects of laughter. Unpleasant laughter spells, or \"sham mirth,\" usually occur in people who have a neurological condition, including patients with pseudobulbar palsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\\'s disease. These patients appear to be laughing out of amusement but report that they are feeling undesirable sensations \"at the time of the punch line\".\\nExcessive elation is a common symptom associated with bipolar disorder psychoses and mania/hypomania. Those who suffer from schizophrenic psychoses seem to suffer the opposite—they do not understand humor or get any joy out of it. A fit describes an abnormal time when one cannot control the laughter or one\\'s body, sometimes leading to seizures or a brief period of unconsciousness. Some believe that fits of laughter represent a form of epilepsy.[32]\\nTherapy[edit]\\nLaughter has been used as a therapeutic tool for many years because it is a natural form of medicine. Laughter is available to everyone and it provides benefits to a person\\'s physical, emotional, and social well being. Some of the benefits of using laughter therapy are that it can relieve stress and relax the whole body.[33] It can also boost the immune system and release endorphins to relieve pain.[34] Additionally, laughter can help prevent heart disease by increasing blood flow and improving the function of blood vessels.[35] Some of the emotional benefits include diminishing anxiety or fear, improving overall mood, and adding joy to one\\'s life. Laughter is also known to reduce allergic reactions in a preliminary study related to dust mite allergy sufferers.[36]\\nLaughter therapy also has some social benefits, such as strengthening relationships, improving teamwork and reducing conflicts, and making oneself more attractive to others. Therefore, whether a person is trying to cope with a terminal illness or just trying to manage their stress or anxiety levels, laughter therapy can be a significant enhancement to their life.[37][38]\\nRamon Mora-Ripoll in his study on The Therapeutic Value Of Laughter In Medicine, stated that laughter therapy is an inexpensive and simple tool that can be used in patient care.[39] It is a tool that is only beneficial when experienced and shared. Care givers need to recognize the importance of laughter and possess the right attitude to pass it on. He went on to say that since this type of therapy is not widely practiced, health care providers will have to learn how to effectively use it. In another survey, researchers looked at how Occupational Therapists and other care givers viewed and used humor with patients as a means of therapy.[40] Many agreed that while they believed it was beneficial to the patients, the proper training was lacking in order to effectively use It.[40] Even though laughter and humor has been used therapeutically in medical conditions, according to Mora-Ripoll, there was not enough data to clearly establish that laughter could be used as an overall means of healing. It did suggest that additional research was still needed since \"well-designed randomized controlled trials have not been conducted to date validating the therapeutic efficacy of laughter.\"[39]\\nIn 2017, an institution in Japan conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of laughter therapy on quality of life in patients with cancer.[41] The study used laughter yoga, comedy, clown and jokes. The result showed that laughter therapy was helpful in improving quality of life and cancer symptoms in some areas for cancer survivors. Improvements were seen in the area of depression, anxiety and stress levels. There were limited harmful side effects. Laughter therapy should be used in conjunction with other cancer treatment.[41]\\nResearch and philosophy[edit]\\nMain article: Gelotology\\nLate 19th-century or early 20th-century depiction of different stages of laughter on advertising cards\\nLaughter in literature, although considered understudied by some,[42] is a subject that has received attention in the written word for millennia. The use of humor and laughter in literary works has been studied and analyzed by many thinkers and writers, from the Ancient Greek philosophers onward. Henri Bergson\\'s Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (Le rire, 1901) is a notable 20th-century contribution.\\nAncient[edit]\\nHerodotus[edit]\\nFor Herodotus, laughers can be distinguished into three types:[43]\\nThose who are innocent of wrongdoing, but ignorant of their own vulnerability\\nThose who are mad\\nThose who are overconfident\\nAccording to Donald Lateiner, Herodotus reports about laughter for valid literary and historiological reasons. \"Herodotus believes either that both nature (better, the gods\\' direction of it) and human nature coincide sufficiently, or that the latter is but an aspect or analogue of the former, so that to the recipient the outcome is suggested.\"[43] When reporting laughter, Herodotus does so in the conviction that it tells the reader something about the future and/or the character of the person laughing. It is also in this sense that it is not coincidental that in about 80% of the times when Herodotus speaks about laughter it is followed by a retribution. \"Men whose laughter deserves report are marked, because laughter connotes scornful disdain, disdain feeling of superiority, and this feeling and the actions which stem from it attract the wrath of the gods.\"[43]\\nModern[edit]\\nSee also: Theories of humor\\nComedian Harold Lloyd laughing.\\nThere is a wide range of experiences with laughter. A 1999 study by two humor researchers asked 80 people to keep a daily laughter record, and found they laughed an average of 18 times per day. However, their study also found a wide range, with some people laughing as many as 89 times per day, and others laughing as few as 0 times per day.[44]\\nHobbes[edit]\\nThomas Hobbes wrote, \"The passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly.\"[citation needed]\\nSchopenhauer[edit]\\nPhilosopher Arthur Schopenhauer devotes the 13th chapter of the first part of his major work, The World as Will and Representation, to laughter.\\nNietzsche[edit]\\nFriedrich Nietzsche distinguishes two different purposes for the use of laughter. In a positive sense, \"man uses the comical as a therapy against the restraining jacket of logic, morality and reason. He needs from time to time a harmless demotion from reason and hardship and in this sense laughter has a positive character for Nietzsche.\"[45] Laughter can, however, also have a negative connotation when it is used for the expression of social conflict. This is expressed, for instance, in The Gay Science : \"Laughter -- Laughter means to be schadenfroh, but with clear conscience.\"[46]\\n\"Possibly Nietzsche\\'s works would have had a totally different effect, if the playful, ironical and joking in his writings would have been factored in better\"[47]\\nBergson[edit]\\nIn Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic, French philosopher Henri Bergson, renowned for his philosophical studies on materiality, memory, life and consciousness, tries to determine the laws of the comic and to understand the fundamental causes of comic situations.[48] His method consists in determining the causes of the comic instead of analyzing its effects. He also deals with laughter in relation to human life, collective imagination and art, to have a better knowledge of society.[49] One of the theories of the essay is that laughter, as a collective activity, has a social and moral role, in forcing people to eliminate their vices. It is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, as it condemns ludicrous and eccentric behaviours.[50]\\nLudovici[edit]\\nAnthony Ludovici developed the thoughts of Hobbes even further in The Secret of Laughter. His conviction is that there\\'s something sinister in laughter, and that the modern omnipresence of humour and the idolatry of it are signs of societal weakness, as instinctive resort to humour became a sort of escapism from responsibility and action. Ludovici considered laughter to be an evolutionary trait and he offered many examples of different triggers for laughter with their own distinct explanations.[51]\\nSee also[edit]\\nDeath from laughter\\nEvil laughter\\nGelotology\\nLaughter in animals\\nLaughter yoga\\nNervous laughter\\nParadoxical laughter\\nPathological laughing and crying\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ Stearns, Frederic Rudolph (1972).

Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo, Listen to it carefully: it is not an articulate, clear, well-defined sound; it is something which would fain be prolonged by reverberating from one to another, something beginning with a crash, to continue in successive rumblings, like thunder in a mountain. Still, this reverberation cannot go on for ever. It can travel within as wide a circle as you please: the circle remains, none the less, a closed one.\\n^ Kawakami, Kiyobumi; Takai-Kawakami, Kiyoko; Tomonaga, Masaki; Suzuki, Juri; Kusaka, Tomiyo; Okai, Takashi (2006). \"Origins of smile and laughter: A preliminary study\" (PDF).

The positives of digital life\\nBY JANNA ANDERSON AND LEE RAINIE\\nThe greatest share of participants in this canvassing said their own experience and their observed experience among friends is that digital life improves many of the dimensions of their work, play and home lives. They cited broad changes for the better as the internet revolutionized everything, from the most pressing intellectual and emotional experiences to some of the most prosaic and everyday aspects of existence.\\nLouis Rossetto, self-proclaimed “troublemaker” and founder and former editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, summed it all up this way: “Digital technology is so broad today as to encompass almost everything. No product is made today, no person moves today, nothing is collected, analyzed or communicated without some ‘digital technology’ being an integral part of it. That, in itself, speaks to the overwhelming ‘value’ of digital technology. It is so useful that in short order it has become an integral part of all of our lives. That doesn’t happen because it makes our lives miserable.”\\nThere is almost no area in which digital technology has not impacted me and my family’s life.\\nLARRY IRVING\\nLarry Irving, co-founder of The Mobile Alliance for Global Good, wrote, “There is almost no area in which digital technology has not impacted me and my family’s life. I work more from home and have more flexibility and a global client base because of digital technology. I monitor my health and keep my physician informed using data technology. My wife has gone back to a graduate school program and is much more connected to school because of technology. My entertainment and reading options have exploded exponentially because of new technologies. Use of home speakers, Internet of Things, AI [artificial intelligence] and other emerging technologies is just impacting my life and likely will become more central. I used to write out first drafts of memos longhand. Increasingly I use a new free beta AI-based transcription service Temi to dictate my first draft and then edit that draft. Even when it’s awful, that first draft is better than staring at that blank piece of paper trying to think of something to say. I have numerous meetings with people I don’t know or only met once or twice previously. Recently I had a meeting with someone I didn’t know well. An app I use Accompany pulled up an email exchange between the two of us a decade ago about an issue we both care about. Accompany also provided me a very recent article where the person I was meeting with discussed the same issue and current concerns. Having that knowledge was incredible useful for our recent meeting and simply could not/would not have been possible without the use of digital technology.”\\nMike Liebhold, senior researcher and distinguished fellow at the Institute for the Future, wrote, “Almost every member of my family regularly uses the internet to inform or improve aspects of their well-being: diet, fitness, health, social interaction with family and friends in person and online, education, entertainment, employment, commerce, finance and civic engagement.”\\nWilliam Schrader, the founding CEO of PSINet, wrote, “Every single day: I have private communications with business associates in Europe, Asia, Latin America and in North America, and I receive emails or social media notices from my family members and their extended friends, and I receive the latest news and alerts from 20 different real news publications (such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the Economist). All of this comes with little effort. And, after doing my local security, I can check every public investment I have made anywhere on earth and I can check my bank accounts and make transactions I deem of import, and I can search for any one or multiple piece of information that I need instantly, with or without Wi-Fi. Yes, I have what I wanted, everything at my fingertips. That means information, knowledge, history, ability to transact. I try to never do this when others are with me, since I love living in the moment. Since I am alone a lot, I can find the time. But I do not condemn or even slightly criticize people for taking a call, checking a text, reading, etc. What we built is what we wanted. It’s just that few people are happier. But, I am OK.”\\nPaul Saffo, a leading Silicon-Valley-based technological forecaster and consulting professor in the School of Engineering at Stanford University, said, “I have had an email address on my business card since 1982, and carry enough electronics on my person to get nervous in lightning storms. Digital connectivity has become like oxygen, utterly essential to my research. The net effect of these innovations has been to tie me more closely to other individuals and extend my interpersonal connections well beyond the pre-internet links of in-person interactions and telecommunications. I have friends – close friends who I have known for well over a decade and with whom I communicate nearly every day. We have never met in-person. In fact, we have never spoken over the phone. At the end of the day, the two of the three highest human desires are the desire to be useful, and the desire to share stories. We have been doing both since our distant ancestors sat around a savanna camp fire sharing their days and their dreams. Now, thanks to digital media, the circle around the campfire has grown to encompass (if we wish) all of humanity.”\\nGarland McCoy, president of the Technology Education Institute, said, “I can be a real-time engaged parent, husband, partner, problem solver, counselor, comforter, etc., while traveling anywhere in the world, and – if I am comfortable with a little inconvenience – I can usually manage this real-time interaction for free! Something that was never possible before. No more ‘Death of a Salesman.’”\\nKyle Rose, principal architect at Akamai Technologies and active Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) participant, wrote, “There are simply too many things to list here. I’ll just hit on three. I can more easily keep in regular contact with friends in distant places. Those with whom I would have lost most contact (because, really, there’s no way I’m going to write letters or spend hours on the phone) I can now maintain a relationship with, sometimes of a fairly deep and interactive nature, via social media. This enables us to pick right up when we do finally see each other in person. Technology eases the difficulties of day-to-day life. Because of the internet, I have access to virtually all of recorded music at all times. I can get up-to-date maps and traffic data to avoid incidents. I can order food, groceries or a taxi, obtain up-to-date information about my flight status, and navigate foreign cities via public transit all from my phone with a few taps of my finger. Finally and relatedly, how the hell did I ever learn anything before the internet? The card catalog? Virtually all of human knowledge is at my fingertips at all times. It is rare that I ask a question of fact that someone hasn’t yet answered, and now many of those answers are available to anyone with access to a search engine. The impact of all of these is profoundly positive. And this is only a taste of what the internet, and technological advances in general, promise.”\\nFred Davis, a futurist/consultant based in North America, wrote, “Messaging apps allow me to connect with people who have given me support, provided a chance to talk about life’s challenges, seek advice and many other things. Access to people is simplified. Chat apps (unlike Facebook) provide a one-on-one connection with another person, which can be more personal, human and healing than posting on social networks. I have been using a Fitbit for a number of years. I have had a heart attack and triple bypass and am pre-diabetic. Getting regular exercise is important, and my Fitbit helps me set and attain fitness goals much more easily than before. The ability to monitor and track my sleep helps me take actions to get better sleep, which definitely increases well-being. By connecting to my Fitbit scale I can also track my weight and tie it to my exercise goals. My Fitbit can connect to a Dexcom blood sugar-testing device that can test blood sugar every five minutes, which is extremely helpful in managing my pre-diabetes.”\\nThese one-liners from anonymous respondents hit on a number of different positive themes:\\n“I can get answers to questions about almost anything just by asking my telephone.”\\n“I can save money on everything, including clothing and shoes, airfares, hotels and eat at better restaurants and drink better wine.”\\n“Navigation via car has dramatically improved, with accurate up-to-date traffic information and destination wayfinding.”\\n“Digital life is being able to speak and see someone – regardless of where you are – on a phone you carry on your person.”\\n“Most people I have dated and approximately all of my friends knew me on the internet first; before such digital connectivity I would have just been lonely.”\\n“Sharing photos of new generations instantly with loved ones on the other side of the world and using video and chat to send/receive money; to joke, to tease, to mourn.”\\n“My son has grown up in a world in which he will never be lost; he will never be without a person to talk to; he will never be stopped from searching for an answer to a query.”\\n“I work remotely for a company halfway around the world, and so does my partner. No need to be at a main office.”\\n“The diffusion of webinars allows me to participate in many events organized in different countries without having to travel to them.”\\n“Digital technology allows me to have better knowledge that empowers me to better support my own health when I face challenges.”\\n“My job didn’t exist 15 years ago. I am a digital content manager.”\\n“It means that we can participate in important moments that time and distance barred us from in the past.”\\n“I feel more supported in good times and bad and laugh more than before I was connected online.”\\nHere is a roundup of the many ways these experts described the benefits they get and the benefits they observe.\\nFamily enrichment and enhancement\\nPamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, said, “My 90-year-old father was on Facebook for the sole purpose of connecting with kids and grandkids who were scattered across the country. Reading and commenting on their posts gave him the ability to participate in the process of their lives. Knowing what the family members were doing increased his sense of involvement and the overall intimacy he experienced with them all. This familiarity also jump-started any family gathering, keeping people who were geographically disparate from feeling like relative strangers and allowing relationships to be more immediately meaningful. Texting in all forms serves the same purpose. Closeness in relationships is achieved by the frequency of contact. The human brain reacts to virtual contact as if it were real, releasing the same neurotransmitters of positive emotion and reward as if people were face to face. Texting allows for the multiple touchpoints, the sharing of life’s process and the reassurance of connection. These experiences replicate the behaviors that developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth described in her ground-breaking work on attachment theory and how people form a secure attachment style, essential to emotional well-being.”\\nThe simplest anecdote is about keeping a family messaging chat open with my wife and children.\\nSTOWE BOYD\\nStowe Boyd, managing director at Work Futures, said, “The simplest anecdote is about keeping a family messaging chat open with my wife and children. My kids – both in their 20s – live in Brooklyn, which is close to where we live, but over an hour away. However, we all participate in the chat, often several times in a day. We share pictures, links, stories, plans. It is simply much lower friction than how I managed to remain in contact – or didn’t, really – with my parents when I was in my 20s. Then it was an occasional phone call, visits when possible, but it was pretty tenuous. And I had what most of my contacts considered an unusually close and caring relationship with my folks. I wouldn’t say my family today is hyperconnected, but we certainly remain very connected, where scarcely a day passes without some interaction between all of us despite the physical distance involved. And this has allowed an extra richness to my life, and I guess theirs, a counter to the possible distance that could otherwise grow in our relations because of the hour of travel that separates us.”\\nDavid Weinberger, a senior researcher at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, said, “The most obvious [difference of digital life] for many of us, I’m sure, is the lowering of the barrier to communication: I am in closer touch with my family – grown kids, siblings, in-laws, the whole group – because we can communicate with everything from texts to video calls. We support one another better and know our daily lives better than we could before.”\\nSonia Jorge, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Internet and head of digital inclusion programs at the Web Foundation, said, “Regardless of where I am, my kids can reach me to talk, text me a message to ask questions, help sort out a plan, to tell me about their day, their worries, I can help them with homework or even music practice over video! And, as all mothers, I have often ‘saved’ many situations! Once I got a message from a school in the middle of an important business meeting and managed to sort the situation without any major issue, and all from a different continent! The ability to stay connected as needed is so important for me and it allows me to be closer, to be there! I cannot imagine [life] otherwise and this allows me to do what I do in ways that would have been very hard before digital connectivity.”\\nSteve Stroh, technology journalist, said, “Two observations. The first is that one of the regrets of my life is that I didn’t work hard enough to stay in touch with all of my family and friends as I moved away from my hometown and got involved in my career. Thus, many of my family and friends that were once dear to me are now estranged – entirely my fault. In my daughter’s generation (born in the 1990s), with social media like Facebook, etc., my daughter’s generation and beyond, they will never get entirely out of touch with family and friends (unless they really want to). They’ll know about significant events in their friends’ and family’s lives as things happen, and can always reach out because there’s a consistent point of contact – the social media messaging, ‘stable’ phone numbers such as mobile, email, etc. The second is that my wife and I maintain a near-daily ‘running conversation’ with my daughter who’s moved away via three-way ‘text’ messaging. We often share photos (of the family pets, as it turns out) and let each other know about important or unimportant – perhaps funny – things that are going on in our lives. So the three of us are never really out of touch, which is a wonderful, wonderful thing. I wish I could do this with MY father (who is, alas, very technophobic).”\\nMaureen Cooney, head of privacy at Sprint, commented, “My mother, who is in her 80s, lives on her own and is a technology leader in our family. Her adoption of cellphone use for calls, texting, email, FaceTime, and photo-sharing, daily use of an iPad and computer to play games and to communicate, participation in social media via Facebook, managing her finances, and even device control in her home via internet connected technology, as well as for entertainment through an Amazon Echo, [which] keeps her connected to us and the wider world as she ages, raising her feelings of confidence, safety, activity and independence. It lets family and friends easily connect with her in many ways in real time, which otherwise would not be the case.”\\nRichard Sambrook, professor of journalism at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, wrote, “Very simply, I can talk to and see my daughter on the other side of the world at low or zero cost via video/smartphone technology in a way that was unthinkable a decade or more ago. It helps hold families together.”\\nPerry Hewitt, vice president of marketing and digital strategy at ITHAKA, said, “We live in an aging society; in the developed world, the population is getting older, people are living longer, and fertility rates are falling. Here in the U.S., where families can be geographically dispersed and family-leave policies minimal, caring for older relatives is difficult. Our family has benefitted from the many technology advances in elder care from cameras to robots to medication reminders to video calling. There is so much available to track critical metrics and improve quality of life – for the elderly and their tapped-out caregivers. I believe we’re still in the infancy of technologies that can improve medical compliance and personal safety, and combat a scourge many older Americans face: loneliness.”\\nMary Chayko, a professor at the Rutgers University’s School of Communication and Information, wrote, “My family and I now stay in contact via an unending series of group texts. While we would have remained connected via letters or phone calls in a pre-digital time, this allows the simpler, more convenient and more frequent sharing of moments both incidental and more meaningful, and keeps us consistently in one another’s minds and hearts.”\\nAlex Halavais, director of the M.A. in social technologies at Arizona State University, said, “We have two children in elementary school. It starts at the same time each day and ends at the same time. The children are generally out of touch with the family during this period. This would not have been unusual when I was in elementary school or when my parents were in elementary school, but the other institutions in our lives have changed this. We have shared family calendars that show who needs to be where and when, but these change with some consistency. While my partner and I both have busy careers, they never fall within clearly defined work hours, and mobile technologies mean that our everyday social and business lives are weaved together rather than blocked in clear periods. Time has changed, except for the kids’ grade school. It remains anchored in one position: the 20th century.”\\nEelco Herder, an assistant professor of computer science whose focus is on personalization and privacy at Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in the Netherlands, wrote, “My husband and I live relatively far away (about two to five hours) from our families and our friends live in several countries. Facebook makes it easier to stay in touch with them, to inform them about important events, to show pictures of our daily lives, and – in return – to be informed about things that matter to them. For me, my circle of online friends has evolved from mainly ‘online contacts’ in the mid-2000s to people whom I know in daily life. As a result, if we meet friends after a year or so without contact, we do not need to give an overview of last year, but just continue the conversation and play a board game. It is also easier now to stay in touch with a larger number of people than in earlier days. Apps like WhatsApp allow us to have daily contact with our families, simply by exchanging short messages or sending quick pictures. This interaction does not replace phone calls and visits, but complements them.”\\nNathaniel Borenstein, chief scientist at Mimecast, said, “In the 1980s and early 90s, people asked me why I cared so much about advancing the capacities of email. My usual reply: ‘Some day I will have grandchildren, and I want to get pictures of them right away, by email.’ This dream came true when I received an email that contained a sonogram image of my twin granddaughters when they were each no bigger than a few cells. I had expected those first pictures to be considerably cuter. Even though I was an evangelist for the future of communication technology, that technology exceeded my wildest imaginings.”\\nGreg Shannon, chief scientist for the CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute, commented, “When I call my dad, who is hard of hearing, the real-time network-enabled transcription service kicks in so that he can understand what I’m saying by reading the words on his screen. This dramatically enhances the quality of our conversation and allows us to be more connected. I’m sure it does wonders for his general health at 90. Our three sons all work in/around software. Their minds are filled with notions of programming frameworks, database schemes and abstract models of what data and interactions mean. It’s [a] world that their grandparents can’t comprehend, and even their aunts and uncles are confused about what they do. Many of their childhood friends are far removed from these conceptualizations of work and value. I am not sure how it affects their well-being per se, but the notion of a shared sense of what work means seems weakened. Living and working in multiple places (Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Mexico) is possible since we can digitally maintain social and business connections remotely and asynchronously. Without such digitally enabled efficiencies it would be very challenging to run such a rich life.”\\nSrinivasan Ramani, a retired research scientist and professor, said, “It was in 1993. My daughter left school in Bombay and moved to college in the U.S. Telecommunication in India was quite bad in those days. The number of telephones, both landline and cellular, was about 3 million. (Compare with the billion or so cellphones we have in the same country now!) I knew it would be difficult for my daughter to call us back soon after arrival at the college, and so had asked her to get access to internet on campus and contact us through email and chat. She did that within hours of arrival. My wife had, to that point, carefully stayed away from the dial-up terminal I had on my study table at home for years. Now, she suddenly demanded to be introduced to the system. She demonstrated that given the right motivation, people can learn to use a dial-up terminal for email and internet chat in two days at the most! Our daughter was, for the next four years, our daughter on the Net!”\\nClaudia L’Amoreaux, digital consultant, wrote, “I started using videoconferencing early. First I used a black-and-white video phone that sent a still image every 5 seconds or so. Friends and I got our hands on one and did some fun experiments with artist techies at the Electronic Cafe in Los Angeles. Later I used Cornell’s CU-SeeMe videoconferencing. A real turning point for me was using the high-end PictureTel videoconferencing system in the early ‘90s. When the PictureTel staff dialed up and connected me to a person in New York City (I was in Monterey, California), as I said hello, tears came involuntarily to my eyes; the intimacy was so unexpected, I was overwhelmed with this encounter with a stranger. Fast forward to five years ago. My 85-year-old mother had a recurrence of cancer. We lived many miles apart. On one of my visits, we went to the phone store and I helped her pick out her first iPhone. It was so awesome to watch her learn to text with her friends. I could FaceTime her from my home while I got my life in order so I could return to take care of her. That phone was a literal lifeline during her last months – a source of joy, a tool for coordinating her care, and a reassurance for me that I could actually see daily how she was doing. I think of all the technology in our lives, videoconferencing technology contributes in a profound way to my well-being, bringing me closer to dear family and friends who live at a distance, or even just across the bay like my daughter does. I love it when we both have time to just hang out together via FaceTime when we can’t be there in person.”\\nKirsten Brodbeck-Kenney, a director, said, “Thanks to social media and video chatting, my parents have been able to be very involved in my child’s life in spite of living on the other side of the country. She is only two and a half, but she knows their faces and voices and feels connected to them, even though she’s only met them a handful of times.”\\nWork creator, enabler and enhancer\\nI spend a great deal of my day online, and being hyperconnected makes it possible to find all the things I need to have a decent quality of life.\\nDEWAYNE HENDRICKS\\nDewayne Hendricks, CEO of Tetherless Access, said, “Living a digital life has made it possible to be self-sustaining financially. I spend a great deal of my day online, and being hyperconnected makes it possible to find all the things I need to have a decent quality of life. The type of life I’m leading now would not have been possible 30 years ago. I take comfort in the fact that I’ve had a hand in shaping a part of this thriving digital Web.”\\nMichael Rogers, a futurist based in North America, said, “I now live half the year in the Sicilian farm country where, thanks to wireless internet access, I can do most of my work. Ten years ago that would have been quite impossible. One of the things I most like about Sicily (besides the obvious attractions) is that while there is plenty of Facebook and email and Twitter, the ‘digital lifestyle’ has not colored private and public life so much as it has in my other home, New York City. Sicily remains a far more face-to-face culture. Why that is the case and how long it will continue is a longer story, but it is ironic that I’m using the new digital tools to avoid the side effects of those same tools.”\\nLarry Roberts, Internet Hall of Fame member, original ARPANET leader, now CEO/CFO/CTO of FSA Technologies, Inc., said, “As I do have 100 Mbps of home internet access, I can mostly work at home. However, file sizes that I need to receive today of 60 MB need Google Drive to deliver, as email capacity is in the dark ages. And the sizes grow every year. Email must adapt as these demands grow and TCP [Transmission Control Protocol] transfer speed also needs to increase as it is stuck in the 1990s at 20-30 Mbps. As shopping has also gone digital, package delivery requiring signature can be easily included when working at home, whereas it would become a major problem otherwise. In fact, work can be seamlessly intermixed with running a household. Eliminating commuting and fixed work hours allows working a 12-hour day (which I need). Thus, with increased internet capacity at home, more work can be done with far less stress for those workers not tied to hardware in the office.”\\nJames Blodgett, an advisory board member with the Lifeboat Foundation, wrote, “Important work is shared. When several string theorists published several papers predicting black hole production at particle colliders, I became involved with the collider controversy. The original safety considerations had glaring holes. … I made contacts with safety experts and scientists who were also concerned. I started a Global Risk Reduction special interest group in Mensa, I became an advisory board member of the Lifeboat Foundation (one of thousands), and I participated in writing petitions and contacting people. … The main thing we accomplished was to get CERN, the organization sponsoring the then-upcoming Large Hadron Collider, to do a second safety study.”\\nMarshall Kirk McKusick, computer scientist, said, “Today I have worked on a problem in my open-source community (FreeBSD) in which over the past 24 hours has involved colleagues in 10 time zones, including Ukraine, Germany, United Kingdom, Massachusetts, Iowa, California, Hawaii, Japan, Australia and India through a combination of email, messaging and IRC [Internet Relay Chat]. This would have been impossible before the internet.”\\nJordan LaBouff, associate professor of psychology at the University of Maine, commented, “There are so many ways, from allowing me to stay connected to my family and other relationships while I travel for work and research, to being able to translate or navigate on the fly in difficult cross-cultural situations. The one that springs to mind is actually my wife’s work experience. Two years ago, due in part to the challenges of living with multiple chronic health conditions, my wife left her successful job as a cell technologist at a local hospital to pursue digital journalism. It has allowed her to work from home and write for a large public audience about research surrounding bipolar disorder. This digital environment provides her employment, and her writing supports thousands of people every week who read her research (that she accesses digitally) and writing and who get social support and well-being tips from it. It’s a remarkable way the digital world has improved our physical one.”\\nTom Wolzien, chairman at The Video Call Center LLC, said, “My family’s creation of The Video Call Center to produce broadcast-quality television from the 4 billion global smartphones (and related patents and other intellectual property to make it reliable and cost effective) has enabled a flattening of traditional live video access, enabling programs based on zero-cost live remotes from about anywhere on the planet without field origination, transport, or control room costs. This means that any media organization can put about anyone on the air from anywhere, restricted only by the depth of the producer’s contact list.”\\nJane Elizabeth, director of the accountability journalism program at the American Press Institute, wrote, “Digital technology has allowed my small non-profit organization to work efficiently and effectively from wherever we are in the world. For non-profits and even small for-profit organizations, you just can’t overstate the positive benefits of this type of mobility. There are absolute cost savings in overhead, travel, hourly wages. And there are qualitative benefits in employee work-life balance, productivity and emotional health.”\\nJeremiah Foster, an open-source technologist at the GENIVI Alliance, said, “I lived and worked in Sweden for about 15 years. Recently I moved back to the United States to be with family since I’m originally from the U.S. I’m able to keep my employment, including my salary, my title and my day-to-day work while living thousands of miles away from the company I work for.”\\nEugene Daniel, a young professional based in the United States, said, “Digital technology impacts every aspect of my daily life. As a member of the media, my job depends on technology (telecommunications, social media, internet). As a person who lives apart from family and loved ones, I depend on digital communication to stay in touch – including frequently connecting on FaceTime with my girlfriend. The uses are endless.”\\nDevin Fidler, a futurist and consultant based in the U.S., commented, “Sites like Upwork have allowed Rethinkery Labs to routinely pull together ‘flash teams’ of colleagues, support and expert advisers in a way that accomplishes many tasks more efficiently than would have been humanly possible before coordination platforms.”\\nFrank Feather, a business futurist and strategist with a focus on digital transformation, commented, “Technology allowed me to quit commuting – which is asinine in this era – to quit my career job, and to become a full-time consultant, thus allowing me to help far more organizations on a freelance-anywhere basis. This has been most fulfilling. Similarly, my children have built worldwide networks of friends and fellow students. We have two adopted daughters, and the internet has allowed one of them to find and connect with her birth family in China. None of this would be possible without the internet. The internet unifies people and combines ideas very easily.”\\nYoram Kalman, an associate professor at the Open University of Israel, wrote, “Digital technology freed me from having to spend all of my work hours in the office. I have been telecommuting and working from home at least part of the week since the late ‘90s. That would not have been possible without the advent of digital communication. It allowed me to better integrate work, family commitments, leisure, health challenges of self, of children and of elderly parents, social commitments, etc. Consequently, my work is more productive. Furthermore, the ability to work across geographical and national borders opened new opportunities that made my work more exciting and fulfilling. Throughout this time, I had to learn and relearn how to use communication technologies in ways that empower me, and how to minimize the harm they cause. It is an ongoing learning challenge.”\\nCharlie Firestone, executive director of the Aspen Institute’s communications and society program, said, “I run an office of seven people. I was able to move from Washington, D.C., to California with little detriment, mostly due to video-conferencing. In our case it is Skype for Business that puts each employee a touch of a button away, and the video changes the interaction from simply voice calls or email. I see video calls, a la FaceTime or Skype to be a common activity of the future in business.”\\nAllen G. Taylor, an author and SQL [Structured Query Language] teacher with Pioneer Academy, said, “Digital technology has given me opportunities that were not possible before the digital revolution began. A vast array of career opportunities opened up in a variety of fields. I became a digital design engineer and moved from there into a variety of related professions. The convenience of digital devices such as personal computers and smartphones has enhanced life greatly, both for me and for every member of my family.”\\nAdam Montville, a vice president at the Center for Internet Security, said, “I have the privilege of working from home each and every day. While there are some aspects of office life I miss, the truth is that technology has made this possible. For our family, this has been immeasurably valuable. I can work more productively at different times of day, all while maintaining healthy boundaries for work/life balance (which really isn’t about hard boundaries as much as it is about unobtrusively blending the two). Before such technology existed, I had to commute. I had to be tied down to a specific schedule each and every day. I couldn’t connect to colleagues from a mountainside or a sailboat. It just wasn’t possible.”\\nAnn Adams, a technical writer based in North America, said, “It gave me a profession; one that did not exist when I was growing up.”\\nVincent Alcazar, director at Vincent Alcazar LLC, wrote, “The growing mobility of labor cannot be underestimated, and the primary enabler is the gig economy with the internet as its engine. The gig economy only grows from here, as does its entwinement within people’s lives.”\\nHealth and wellness aid\\nAvery Holton, an associate professor of communication at The University of Utah, commented, “As someone who has twice experienced the impact of cancer, once at the beginning of digital and social media and once in 2016, I feel more empowered by the ability to be transparent and accepted. Yes, we all still enjoy sharing those moments in our lives that give off the best appearance, but the stigma of sharing experiences of disease or pain or loss has lessened. More and more, we are encouraged by the actions or the postings of others to share our tougher experiences and to, if we so wish, build a community around those experiences. The first time I went through cancer, I felt lost and disconnected and without voice. This time, though it admittedly took some coaxing from friends and other supporters, I shared my experience and my recovery. That really helped me through the process and into a quicker, more lasting mental, emotional and physical recovery.”\\nMy online network and digital tools made it easy to share the event, his progress, my stress and feelings, for others to empathize and share resources and advice.\\nSUSAN PRICE\\nSusan Price, lead experience strategist at the United Services Automobile Association (USAA), commented, “My husband had a stroke last year. My online network and digital tools made it easy to share the event, his progress, my stress and feelings, for others to empathize and share resources and advice. I found myself carefully segregating my communications by channel, moderating the degree of honesty according to the size and makeup of the group. I report to the largest group in Facebook ‘sanitized’ updates of mostly hopeful progress reports and vignettes that show me or my husband in a flattering or inspirational light. I avoid upsetting others with starkly honest or too-revealing stories of my own or my husband’s pain, frustration or lack of coping. My husband is aware of my propensity to share, and has asked directly when we’re discussing a fraught situation, ‘This isn’t going on Facebook, is it? Good!’ But he suggested my posting and sharing some achievements. Because of its ubiquity and reach, Facebook helped me identify select others in my network – many of whom I hadn’t spoken with in 10 to 20 years – who had directly relevant experience with caregiving of stroke survivors and adjusting when a partner suffers a severe health crisis. With those found veterans, I moved the discussion to more private channels such as Facebook Messenger, email or phone to share more honestly my negative feelings, fears and pain, and received directly helpful specific advice, support and resources. I’ve also used caregiver forums to connect with quickly available communities of peers in situations much closer to my own.”\\nGina Neff, an associate professor and senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, said, “Digital technology has been a godsend for care-givers, allowing people to coordinate their efforts to help during cancer treatment, when a newborn arrives, or during a health crisis. Apps and websites cannot replace the communities that have always connected and supported us, but they can help diverse and dispersed groups coordinate care in unprecedented ways.”\\nBradford Hesse, chief of health communication and informatics research at the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said, “I now stay in closer contact with my healthcare provider than I ever have before. If I have a question, I can ask it through secure messaging. If I want to evaluate my own recent blood panels for areas of concern or progress, I can do that online through a secure portal. Robocalls to my house from my provider as well as text messages to my phone ensure that I do not miss a recommended cancer screening. I watch my diet more rigorously with the help of a diet app on my smartphone equipped with camera to retrieve caloric/nutritional information, and I monitor my exercise goals through the use of my Apple Watch wearable. If I have a complaint, it is usually because the ecosystem of medicine is still not connected enough. There are laggards who resist sharing my electronic health record data with specialists as needed. There is 20th-century thinking that prevents these digital technologies from being fully integrated into the medical system in ways that will be cost-efficient, interoperable, empowering and truly usable.”\\nThomas Lenzo, a respondent who shared no additional identifying details, commented, “Digital technology has facilitated my management of various aspects of my healthcare. I am able to schedule appointments and order prescription refills online, at any time of day. I can get detailed text or video information about health issues from trusted sources. I have access via portals to my health records. I also tell family and friends how they can use digital technology to impact their health.”\\nEd Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said, “The ability to monitor the medical records, procedures, medicines of a loved one remotely provides opportunity for quality oversight and rapid response, in contrast to being tied to hospital visits and uncertainty.”\\nGary L. Kreps, distinguished professor and director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University, wrote, “My family and I use wearable fitness trackers that tally our daily exercise behaviors (steps). This has influenced both our awareness of our physical activity and motivation to exercise regularly. We strive to accomplish our 10,000 daily steps! We also compare our exercise levels and encourage each other to engage in physical activity. We now seek opportunities to exercise together to achieve our activity goals. This has improved our overall physical activity, fitness and health.”\\nKevin J. Payne, founder of Chronic Cow LLC, said, “Since I research the effects of chronic illness and live with multiple sclerosis, I have a particular interest in using these technologies to monitor and evaluate my condition, keep up on the latest research, and connect with others – both professionals and others living with chronic conditions. My life has been radically affected by these burgeoning technologies on all these fronts. It allows me to collect my own data, blend it with other datasets and generate and test real-time predictive algorithms. I have a far better understanding of my condition, especially as it is baselined against relevant populations. I not only get access to cutting edge pre-print research, but I’ve also been able to widen my professional network by communicating with the researchers. And my involvement with patient communities has enriched my life in many ways.”\\nDavid Myers, a professor of psychology at Hope College, wrote, “As a person with hearing loss and an advocate for a hearing-assistive technology that has great promise (www.hearingloop.org), the internet has networked me with kindred spirit advocates nationwide (also via 19,898 emails I have sent and 18,516 received with the words ‘hearing’ and ‘loop’). Together, our internet-facilitated ‘hearing loop’ advocacy has led to thousands of newly equipped facilities, from home TV rooms to worship places to auditoriums to airports (and New York City subway booths and new taxis). And more progress is on the horizon. Supported by digital technology, we are making a better world for people with hearing loss.”\\nBob Frankston, a technologist based in North America, said, “I once had a rash and my GP [doctor in general practice] wanted to look it at. Fortunately we had a friend in common who was able to forward a simple digital picture I took and quickly resolved the issue. It’s a reminder that digital health doesn’t have to be complex and expensive. Sending a picture is simple and inexpensive yet can make a big difference – a huge benefit vs. cost. We need to appreciate the value of the mundane rather than focusing on the flashy stories.”\\nDoug Breitbart, co-founder and co-director of The Values Foundation, said, “In my life I have experienced significant adverse changes and circumstance, living situation and health. Virtual connectivity via the internet has enabled me to establish networks of connections, collaborative communities and new friendships and relationships with people around the world.”\\nLeah Robin, a health scientist based in North America, said, “My family has a genetic form of anemia that is very rare. Because of digital technology we’ve been able to make contact with researchers, take advantage of on-going research, and provide and receive support from other patients from around the world. The impact has been, at times, lifesaving for my family members.”\\nChristopher Bull, a university librarian, said, “I had an itchy rash on my hands. Found articles on the internet which suggested using witch hazel. No rash, no itch.”\\nCommunity lifeline\\nEthan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT, wrote, “I went through a divorce recently and wrote about my experiences online. While there are few folks in my immediate community who are going through divorce, I found several friends in other cities in my extended circles who had excellent support and advice. One of the most supportive individuals was an acquaintance from college who was not a close friend, but who stepped up on Facebook and was a wonderful support to me from halfway around the country.”\\nTogether, we grow intelligence, connect up one another’s work and support positive social change just by doing our work, following one another and sharing what’s meaningful more widely.\\nANNE COLLIER\\nAnne Collier, consultant and executive at The Net Safety Collaborative, said, “I ‘talk’ with people all over the world on a daily basis on Twitter – seeing, learning from, supporting and spreading what’s meaningful to them in their work and lives. It’s a tremendous source of inspiration for me. Together, we grow intelligence, connect up one another’s work and support positive social change just by doing our work, following one another and sharing what’s meaningful more widely.”\\nKathryn Campbell, a digital experience design consultant, said, “I have a young friend who lives in another state in a rural area. Over time, I have realized from their social media posts that he/she is emerging as gender non-conforming (probably transsexual). In the past, this is a journey that I would probably not have known about, especially since his/her immediate family is very conservative and have not accepted this facet of the young person’s identity. I am so grateful to have been included in this revelation so I can offer my unconditional love and support. And I am even more grateful that a person who in the past would have felt isolated, unnatural, and broken now knows that they are in fact part of a global community. He/she can find and utilize peer support groups as well as myriad medical, psychological and spiritual resources that would not have been available to someone in a small town in the past. I believe this will probably save lives. I definitely hope that it will help increase our ability as a society to accept others who don’t conform to our preconceived notions of what is normal.”\\nAna Cristina Amoroso das Neves, director of the department for the information society at Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, said, “The smartphone has become a part of my family life. The current organisation we have and the data we can share more than modified the way we interact. There is no waste of time and therefore we all gain efficiency in our daily life. The dawn of Internet of Things is already embedded. … If there is an electricity glitch, we cannot even think how will we survive due to the new paradigm we have in our lives. Hyperconnection is part of my family and friends’ well-being. It is nothing that can be compared with the life my parents had. I wonder how I could have survived in that society, living before total digital connectivity existed, even when it had just started and was not spread yet.”\\nDeborah Lupton, a professor at University of Canberra’s News & Media Research Centre, said, “I live in a vast continent (Australia) where academics are scattered many kilometres from each other, and it is a very long, expensive and exhausting plane ride from my colleagues in the Northern Hemisphere. However, I have extensive networks with my colleagues on Twitter and Facebook. I enjoy taking time out to chat with them, sharing professional and also some personal information regularly. It makes me feel less isolated and more easily able to keep in contact with my academic network. Nothing beats face-to-face encounters, but social media and emails, as well as the occasional use of Skype, is a far better way to maintain these contacts than letter writing or faxing, which is how we did things before digital media.”\\nAndrew Czernek, a former vice president of technology at a personal computer company, wrote, “Email and websites were the first place that we were able to see family and people with the same interests share information rapidly. Twenty years ago I set up two websites – one for pilots and one for family members – to share photos, family tree[s] and technical information. Both have been resounding successes in getting people together. For family, it has allowed easy distribution of ancestor’s photos and extension of a family tree from several hundred people to more than 3,000. About every five years I have to take our family tree back to the calligrapher to add ancestors that we didn’t know about – including, recently, a soldier who was with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge. Now we’re starting to see services like voice-controlled appliances in the home and the extension of cellphone service throughout the world. Forty years ago I taught in a small Congo town that was isolated, with no phone or TV service. Today Kasongo can be reached by cellphone and the regional center has television and internet access thanks to wireless technologies.”\\nNancy Heltman, visitor services director for Virginia State Parks, said, “I have met and developed relationships with people outside any sphere of reference I never would have had thanks to my digital life. This started when I worked on the 2008 Obama campaign, includes people I met through a group where we shared our love for household pets and goes through today where I have a relationship with customers that I never would have met personally. While I do not believe that my online relationships replace ones that involve personal face-to-face connections, they are important and have broadened my horizons in many ways, adding a richness to my life. In fact my more-traditional face-to-face relationships have also benefited from more communication due to digital communications. When forced to only have relationships with people you can meet in person, you tend to live in a more-narrow world, with people more like you. Digital communications broadens your horizons, or it can if you want it to.”\\nSocial media: The horizon expander\\nMichael R. Nelson, public policy expert with Cloudflare, said, “I’m an avid user of social media, which I use to track developments in internet policy around the world. Almost every day, one of the people I follow on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn shares a report, law review article, economic analysis, or news article on something I need to know about and would not have discovered by just reading the U.S. newspapers and media sites I track regularly. Equally importantly, my Facebook and LinkedIn friends introduce me to experts in the field in countries around the world – without my having to spend time flying overseas to attend conferences. In 2017, I was able to be a fun participant in the Global Conference in Cyber Space in New Delhi without missing Thanksgiving with my family. Likewise, I was able to be a remote participant at the UN’s Internet Governance Forum in Geneva without leaving my house (as long as I was willing to tune into the webcast at 4 a.m.).”\\nAlexander B. Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, wrote, “I’ve been using computers for over three decades now, since logging on through a BBS [bulletin board system] in 1993. My professional life as a writer, analyst, consultant and now deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation is almost entirely enabled by digital technology, from the journalism I created to the advocacy, activism, policy and communications work I do today. Social media has opened many doors for me, professionally and personally, in ways I did not anticipate a decade ago. The smartphones I began using last decade dramatically improved that work, enabling me to be informed, report and collaborate in extraordinarily flexible ways across time and space – and to easily travel through many foreign cities and nations.”\\nDan Rickershauser, senior account manager at StumbleUpon, said, “I was born in 1987. When I first signed up for Facebook, I was a senior in high school and you needed a dot-edu [.edu] email address to gain access. We were all welcomed onto the platform as we got new email addresses once accepted into our college of choice. It was a place to show friends and acquaintances how much fun we were having in college. And then over time it became so much more. My parents had Facebook accounts. Work relationships became Facebook friends. It was a tough to navigate as its role in my life shifted. I scaled back how much I shared there. I changed what I projected out to masses. My sister-in-law, by time she hit college age, knew Facebook as a place where her grandmother kept track of everyone’s comings and goings. All of this happened in the span of seven years. For her, Snapchat replaced Facebook as the place to showcase to acquaintances how much fun she was having in college. I now use Facebook to see which of my friends have gotten married or had children. I’m still thankful it’s around, but the role it’s played in my life has changed. For people a generation younger, it’s been the place I remembered it as. It will be interesting to see what’s in store for these platforms, but already I can now see people my age pulling away from social networks like Facebook, often times for their own well-being. As the role platforms like Facebook play in our lives shifts, so too does our need for them. It will be interesting to see if they survive these shifts.”\\nMichael Roberts, an internet pioneer and Internet Hall of Fame member, commented “Despite its well-known problems, I find that Facebook is important to me in a number of ways. 1) Keeping up with professional friends around the globe now that I am retired. For an old fart (81), it is a source of daily intellectual stimulation and a feeling of keeping my hand in the game. 2) A window into many marvelous places and activities. I am a railfan and there are restored steam engines, abandoned trackage, lonely and empty depots, etc., to fill any amount of time I have available. Name your hobby or sport, and there are folks out there to share their discoveries with you. 3) The original ‘family and friends’ angle. My siblings and I are all over the U.S. Facebook lets us pretend we are close (Worldwide webcams add a lot as well). There are lots of other examples – politics, medicine, personal safety, education.”\\nJerry Michalski, founder of the Relationship Economy eXpedition, said, “I now have peripheral vision into the lives of family, friends and acquaintances a few degrees from me – all voluntarily. When I see them, I don’t need to ask ‘what’s up,’ but can say ‘I’m glad your daughter got through her operation,’ or whatever is appropriate for the state of their lives I can observe. Those weak ties are priceless, and lead to insights. In the early days of Twitter, I left a meeting and tweeted something like, ‘Just left a mtg about the cash health care economy. Had no idea it existed or was big.’ At the time, I had set up for all my tweets to forward to Facebook, and the next day I got a fascinating eight-paragraph note on Facebook from an acquaintance who had taken his family off regular health insurance years ago, and was very happy with the outcomes. On the other hand, I am among the Satanic Device Addicts who check email on their phones first thing in the morning (it’s on the night table, right?) and tap and prod them all day long, in search of those little dopamine hits.”\\n… All of us now have the ability to find ‘our people’ – those who share our interests and passions and concerns – in ways that we couldn’t when our connective avenues were limited by time and geography.\\nSCOTT MCLEOD\\nScott McLeod, a professor at the University of Colorado Denver, wrote, “My decade-plus of blogging and other social media usage has connected me with hundreds of thousands of educators and education thought leaders in global dialogue spaces and communities of practice in ways that would be impossible without the internet. My visibility and reach are now astronomical compared to what they might be in an analog era. My example is but a microcosm of the possibilities that we all now have available to us. The gay teenager in rural America; the handmade Japanese sword aficionado; the stay-at-home mom struggling with a rare disease; the LARPer [live-action roleplaying gamer] looking to connect with others; all of us now have the ability to find ‘our people’ – those who share our interests and passions and concerns – in ways that we couldn’t when our connective avenues were limited by time and geography.”\\nJason Hong, professor at the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote, “WeChat is not well known in the U.S., but is perhaps the most popular app in China. It’s primarily a messaging app, like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, but also serves as a social network and message board. What’s really amazing is how it’s really helped my family (from China) connect with others here in the U.S. My father-in-law found people to go fishing with. My mother-in-law found a monthly foodies group to go to. My wife found some of her old high school classmates, plus a group of people that buy foods in bulk at discount and split the costs. As for me, well, I’m the boring one, I just use it to send text messages and emoji to my wife. For my family, WeChat works well because it lowers the transaction costs of finding individuals with similar interests and backgrounds. My parents-in-law don’t speak much English, so WeChat acts as a major filter for people who do speak Chinese. WeChat also lets you organize message boards by geography, making it easy to find groups that are geographically nearby. It’s pretty amazing, since these weren’t really problems that we knew we had, and the WeChat groups just filled those needs quite nicely. Furthermore, it was a good tool that let us first find people virtually and then transition to real-world relationships.”\\nRichard Bennett, a creator of the Wifi MAC protocol and modern Ethernet, commented, “Facebook was useful for spreading the word to my extended family about the status of two relatives who died of pancreatic cancer recently. In one case, a sister-in-law in another country used me as a go-between to reach my wife, and in another I used it to contact a former stepbrother, a sister and a half brother. As modern families become more complex, communication tools have had to adapt.”\\nLisa Nielsen, director of digital learning at the New York City Department of Education, said, “I am the administrator of several Facebook groups around areas of personal interest such as hobbies, sports, career (education). I started a Facebook group for teachers at the New York City Department of Education who love teaching with technology. In the past all these people existed in the 1,800 schools across the city, but there was no way for these people to find one another. The group now has close to 3,000 members. It is highly active, and strong relationships are being built. We have a direct line to what is happening in schools. Teachers feel supported like never before. They are more confident and better able to serve their students. They have increased job satisfaction. They share extreme gratitude for the group and its responsiveness. They are no longer alone but rather supported by a powerful network of other dedicated teachers.”\\nKnowledge storehouse\\nStephen Downes, a senior research officer at the National Research Council Canada, commented, “I don’t have a small story, I have a big story. I have a career that has allowed me to be a force for good, to reach people around the world, and to share a message of compassion, communication and development, all solely because of the internet and digital technologies. I landed my first real job in the computer industry in 1981, with Texas Instruments’ Geophysical Services in Calgary. This enabled me to attend university, where I studied philosophy. I wrote my honors thesis on an Atari and I wrote my masters on the university network. I started teaching using technology for Athabasca University in 1987, and started developing websites and learning management systems for a living in 1995. By participating and sharing my knowledge and discoveries freely through discussion lists and online conferences I became a part of the online learning community in Canada, which led to my current employment as a digital researcher with the federal government. This has given me the opportunity to develop new theories of learning and pedagogy, create learning technologies, develop MOOCs [massive open online courses], and participate in this survey. Every week there’s a story. Today I responded to an enquiry from a reader looking for more recent work on automated language translation, because she had only a reference to my paper from 2001. I provided her with some resources from my newsletter, and she will add these to her study. Last week someone literally said to me ‘You changed my life’ because of the influence of the first MOOC I taught alongside George Siemens in 2008. The course was about computer networking and personal empowerment and how people can create their own education. The week before I was able to carry a message about business intelligence into a meeting with government officials as a result of the analysis I did of the public documents posted by the School of Public Service on their web page. The week before I was in Berlin at a conference testing a virtualization of my personal learning application, getting experiences and feedback from a workshop filled with experts from around the world, none of whom I had met before. The week before I was in Tunisia talking about the deployment of open educational resources in the Middle East and Northern Africa to support language learning, economic development, and cultural growth. The week before… You get the idea. None of this happens without digital technology. It’s not a nice neat story that fits a sidebar, but it’s real, and each week there’s real growth, real development.”\\nJeff Jarvis, a professor at City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism, said, “I count as an unfathomable luxury the ability to look up most any fact, any book, any news article at no cost and in seconds. I value the friends I have made from a tremendous diversity of background and worldviews thanks to the connected Net. I welcome many – though certainly not all – new voices I can hear now thanks to the Net putting a printing press in anyone’s hands. And not incidentally, I have transformed my career thanks to the lessons I continually learn by and about the Net.”\\nDeborah Hensler, professor of law at Stanford University, wrote, “On a personal level, digital technology enables me to work more productively from any place in the world. It provides access to a vast store of information and research data. It has enabled me to collaborate with academic colleagues in many different parts of the world, which has been an incredibly generative experience. In my personal life, it connects me to far-flung family and friends. It also connects me to people who share my political views, which gives me some hope – perhaps foolish – that working with them I can shift the political discourse.”\\nRay Schroeder, associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois Springfield, wrote, “I have been engaged in teaching, researching and presenting/publishing in advocating educational technology in higher education over the past 46 years. As I think back over those nearly five decades, my impact and reach today is far greater than I had ever imagined in 1971 or ‘81 or even 2001. Through the use of social media, I am able to share resources and perspectives to tens of thousands of others in my field on a daily basis. The prospect that one person could manage that scope of impact and reach was inconceivable for anyone who was not a network commentator on television or a nationally syndicated columnist. Now this opportunity extends to all who are dedicated to a purpose or cause.”\\nLarry MacDonald, CEO of Edison Innovations, wrote, “Sharing enables power to flow to those who ‘know’ rather than only those who control. People have a better grasp of news and tools that can make their lives easier. Knowledge disseminates faster and deeper.”\\nProblem solver and wonder creator\\nHal Varian, chief economist at Google, commented, “I was in Rio trying to communicate with a taxi driver a few months before the Olympics. The driver pulled out his phone and clicked on Google Translate. Problem solved. Turns out that Google had trained all the taxi drivers in Rio how to use this fantastic tool.”\\nIn terms of the spread of knowledge, the past two decades have been as revolutionary as when early man harnessed fire.\\nKENNETH CUKIER\\nKenneth Cukier, senior editor at The Economist, wrote, “In researching my new book on AI, I came across a citation of a relevant document from the 1950s by the East German secret police, the Stasi. I Googled it and got a digital copy – which, when you think about it, is amazing. But my German is lousy. So I uploaded the 35-page report into Google Translate and got an English version a minute later – which is even more astounding. Just 20 years ago it was impossible for all but the most prestigious scholar to obtain something like that, and it might take half a year. I did it on impulse in four minutes. In terms of the spread of knowledge, the past two decades have been as revolutionary as when early man harnessed fire.”\\nVint Cerf, Internet Hall of Fame member and vice president and chief internet evangelist at Google, commented, “I moved my wife from an older iPhone with AT&T service to a Google Pixel 2 with Google Fi service. It took 10 minutes and did NOT require physical modification or even installation of a SIM card. I got confirmation from AT&T within minutes that the account and phone number had been transferred. I was astonished.”\\nGinger Paque, a lecturer and researcher with DiploFoundation, wrote, “Digital technology offers amazing opportunities for inclusion and access not only to overcome challenges of distance, but offering wider choices, asynchronous collaboration on shared projects, online meetings, telemedicine, and myriad other advantages. My particular experience in addition to my clear connections to global online learning, highlights the possibilities for inclusion in global policy processes, especially those involving internet governance and digital policy. The UN Internet Governance Forum, for example, takes place in situ during less than a week once a year, and even that week of meetings involves a high percentage of online participants from all over the world. However, the planning for this event takes place online all year, with collaboration from a large body of participants from all over the world. Without internet technology and online applications for collaborative editing and meetings, this kind of global, geographic, and multi-stakeholder (I add multi-stakeholder as a factor, because some stakeholder groups have more access to travel funds.) Multi-stakeholderism would be seriously hampered and cooperation would not be possible. In addition to the IGF [Internet Governance Forum], the ITU [International Telecommunication Union], Internet Society and other organisations have also developed procedures that allow for year-round work involving all regions. In addition to fairly normal and common challenges for travel to meetings, I have had serious family responsibilities that have not permitted me to travel in the last few years. While it has not been easy, I have been able to stay involved.”\\nBart Knijnenburg, assistant professor at Clemson University, said, “Seven years ago, when I got my first iPhone with FaceTime, I was calling my fiancée (who was living on the other side of the country) on my bike ride home from work. Out of nowhere a number of hot air balloons appeared, and with the touch of a button I was able to switch to a video call. I remember being amazed by the simplicity with which I was able to share this experience. Nowadays, communicating with people anywhere in the world has become second nature to me. Sometimes I realize that I have written several research papers with people whom I have never met in person!”\\nHeywood Sloane, partner and co-founder of HealthStyles.net, said, “The criterion I used for my most recent purchase of a smartwatch was that it NOT try to be a watch. I have one already, a gift from my wife that I am very fond of, thank you! I expected, and got, a multitude of tools to help me stay on track with stress, sleep, biometrics and much more. What I did not expect, was the way it tamed the peppering of email, notifications by apps, ringtones and alarms of people and things clamoring for my immediate attention. It reduces them all to gentle vibrations. Long ones for calls I wanted to take, and short ones for everything else. It lets me block interruptions from apps and emailers. It also let me see others and get more detail with a tap when I want it. It gives me control and helps me defend my space to concentrate and focus on what I choose, rather than what someone else chooses.”\\nThomas Viall, president of Rhode Island Interactive, commented, “Just this past Christmas shopping season is a great example of how digital technology was beneficial. We could text our relatives rather than interrupt them with a call. They were able to share their wish list, we could comparison shop online (at both local and national stores), find the best value, search for coupons and either order online or use navigation to find the best route to the store despite holiday traffic.”\\nEducation tool\\nOlugbenga Adesida, founder and CEO of Bonako, based in Africa, wrote, “The digital revolution has changed social relationships and the way we communicate. In some African countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe, mobile payment transactions are responsible for over 40% of GDP. Mobile apps are used to deliver education as well as providing timely information to farmers to enhance their productivity. Similarly, mobile apps are used to deliver price and other market information. At our firm – Bonako a mobile games and app-development company – it is our platform for continuous education for staff; it is what we use to access training materials from all over the world. We also use digital tools to plan and develop our products in a way that would not have been possible only a few years ago. Developing games and apps requires varied expertise, and collaboration is key. The new tools for collaborative work allow us to work together and to provide virtual access to potential partners/clients to test products no matter where they are in the world.”\\nKarl M. van Meter, founding director of the bilingual scientific quarterly Bulletin of Sociological Methodology, said, “Far from being a ‘brief personal anecdote,’ what has changed greatly in my life and work, like that of almost everyone in higher education and research, is that the internet and associated technologies mean that no longer only a few top persons have access to the necessary information, technology and means for scientific production and teaching. It is no longer only the director (always a male) who gets his secretary (always a female) to type out his paper and check references before having it published. Almost all competent teachers and researchers have that possibility now; moreover they can work together over great distances and form social structures among themselves, independent of centralized or local administrative control. A ‘brief personal anecdote’ along these lines would be when a national director of scientific research here in France asked to be appointed to an international body associated with UNESCO. That body replied very respectfully to the director that they had already found a better candidate from France who had been working with them via the internet. That other candidate was me.”\\nToday, students I help mentor through their own doctoral studies have access to all of the material I did two decades ago, but with a fraction of the time and travel commitment.\\nGREG DOWNEY\\nGreg Downey, a professor and associate dean at University of Wisconsin, Madison, said, “When I was a graduate student at a U.S. private research university in the late 1990s, I spent many hours gathering background context for the beginning of a major historical and social research project, tracking down physical newspaper indexes, footnote references, printed journal volumes and microfilm reels from dozens of access-restricted research libraries. Weeks and months of ‘metadata labor’ on a particular idea might lead to a viable research project and a source of accessible primary research materials – or to a dead end and a need to start all over. I recall being among the first users of some of the online image databases produced by the federal government to find visual evidence that I simply wouldn’t have had the ability to access (or even know it existed) even five years earlier. Similarly, once materials were acquired and assembled, only rudimentary organization and writing tools were available for assembling the project into a coherent narrative. I recall being one of the first individuals at my university to use Geographic Information Systems software in my historical analysis and in the production of my final manuscript. All of the temporal and spatial expectations of earning a Ph.D. in the humanities and interpretive social sciences were tied to expectations of analog, print and physically housed resources. Today, students I help mentor through their own doctoral studies have access to all of the material I did two decades ago, but with a fraction of the time and travel commitment. This has raised the expectations for comprehensiveness in literature reviews and archival searches; it has raised the expectations for presentation of data and engagement of narrative. It is both easier and harder to do great work now and get that Ph.D. within the same five-year time period. But I think the work that is done is of higher quality, and the scholars that are produced are of greater intellectual prowess and scope than ever before.”\\nAdriana Labardini Inzunza, commissioner of Mexico’s Federal Institute of Telecommunications, said, “There are so many stories of how IT and internet have made my work more productive and my access to relevant information far easier – hopefully for others around me as well. As a commissioner at the Federal Institute of Telecommunications I made sure that our virtual board meetings and deliberations were valid; on many occasions I have been able to deliberate and vote on the cases submitted to the board through a video conference when in business travels and I also to hold e-meetings with my staff. My office has home-office on Mondays, saving hours of wasted time on traffic jams. …\\n“A more striking story perhaps is that of Marce, a smart, determined and brave 19-year-old girl from Xochicalco, an isolated village in the middle of the mountains of Guerrero, 350 kilometers away from Acapulco. Marce studied elementary and middle school in a rural local school, but there is no high school in Xochicalco, so she would have had to travel each day to Arcelia, Gro. [Guerrero], the seat of that municipality and the closest connected town in the area, 40 miles away, with a daily cost of public transportation of around $4, something totally beyond the family’s budget. Her father is a skilled electrician working in the area for a Canadian mining company that pays minimum wages to local people ($4 per day). Her mother grows corn and vegetables and looks after her other two children. So Marce ended up leaving her hometown and moving to the big city of Mexico to seek a job as domestic helper, hoping she could enroll at a public school. Her job kept her busy all day as a babysitter and so her mom, who I had the fortune to know from a long time ago, asked me for help to guide Marce so that she actually gets an education.\\n“Marce moved to my house, but in searching for an affordable high school nearby she encountered many obstacles. I devoted a few hours to seek a public high school online program certified by our Ministry of Education (SEP) and found it, a very impressive two-year program which begins with a full-month course on the use of IT, the platform, how to interact with your assigned tutor, with teachers, how to deliver homework online, etc. I had never seen a young girl so excited to spend online 4 hours, learn in three days to handle a laptop one of my sons gave her. She reads her lessons every day plus a few books I am asking her to read on history, philosophy, etc. She reads 10 pages every morning. It’s been only three months since she started, and she loves it, she is learning, and finished at the top of her class this quarter. She feels empowered, hopeful, her parents feel relieved that she doesn’t have to travel two hours a day to attend school and pay fares. Yet it will take a lot of guidance, hard work and long hours before she earns a high school diploma and more importantly, a good quality education that enables her to be admitted at UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] or another public university here in Mexico City. There is no such a thing in Arcelia, forget Xochicalco, where there is no internet access and a weak signal for only 2G mobile voice services in spite of the presence of a multinational firm extracting all the lithium it can get from Guerrero but not creating much local value to the hard-working people of Xochicalco. I am committed to help Marce, and she is determined to graduate and pursue her professional education. She wants to become a chef. With a good use of time and technology, discipline and some degree of guidance and support from my sons I may hopefully help her thrive.”\\nJacob Dankasa, a North American researcher, said, “Technology has connected me to achieve today what I couldn’t imagine in the past. When I was doing my doctoral dissertation, I was supposed to travel to Nigeria from the U.S. to conduct interviews with my research participants. Unfortunately, the Ebola epidemic blew up in Africa and I was unable to go. Fortunately, software existed that allowed me to interview the participants and automatically record the sessions as I interviewed them. The price was reasonable. It saved me money and time and avoided health hazards. More and better innovations are expected in this area in the future.”\\nTravel companion and enhancer\\nPaul Jones, a professor of information science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and internet pioneer, wrote, “I am traveling to Casablanca Sunday. My tour was booked in China. I’ll stop at Rick’s Café, which is designed to look like the imagined cafe built on a back lot in Burbank in the 1940s [for the film ‘Casablanca.’] Friends who are writers have recommended their friends [for me] to meet while I’m there. Through social media we are already in touch. One friend wrote a profile of the Rick’s founder in 2006. She remembers him and has been in touch. The seamlessness and timeliness of casual connections made stronger still amazes me. … What’s not to like?”\\nI travel a lot and have vastly more flexibility and local knowledge at hand due to my devices. I see things I would not have seen, travel without having to plan every stop in advance and find the things that matter to me. I get better hotels and food, too.\\nBRAD TEMPLETON\\nBrad Templeton, software architect, civil rights advocate, entrepreneur and internet pioneer, wrote, “I travel a lot and have vastly more flexibility and local knowledge at hand due to my devices. I see things I would not have seen, travel without having to plan every stop in advance and find the things that matter to me. I get better hotels and food, too.”\\nJon Lebkowsky, CEO of Polycot Associates, said, “A week or so ago we headed off to a party at a house we’d never visited. We entered the address in Google Maps, so we had a guide (we call her ‘Lucy’) taking us where we need to go. It was a circuitous route – without Lucy we likely would have taken wrong turns – and I was thinking how much we now depend on that technology, not just to get us where we want to go, but also to route us around traffic congestion. Soon enough, we’ll be stepping into autonomous vehicles, vocalizing an address and relaxing for the duration of the ride. Digital technology for transportation efficiency is revolutionary.”\\nSafety enabler\\nAlejandro Pisanty, a professor at Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and longtime leading participant in the activities of the Internet Society, wrote, “The ability to use digital tools for everything I do – from professional work, like teaching and research, to the most personal – finding long-separated relatives after the family dispersed from Europe to at least three continents in the 1930s-1940s – has been a continued benefit. Using lightweight online tools in class helps my students in the National University of Mexico grasp concepts and communicate them to their families. During the aftermath of the earthquakes in Mexico in 2017 this became particularly valuable for them; it also helped fight misinformation and take relief efforts to the places that most needed them. We went from the basics of oscillation and wave physics, through the propagation of different kinds of seismic waves. To the ways buildings are damaged and how to identify fatal structural flaws. In parallel we helped brigades take aid to small towns and to camps in Mexico City, and some of the most far-flung ones find safe havens from which to distribute aid.”\\nPedro Cartagena, an associate professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said, “After hurricane María in Puerto Rico, the internet was the only communications resource in order to contact my family members, buy solar panels and get other essentials for survival.”\\nApps for ordering car rides via a smartphone is a net benefit to society – it increases safety for both the passenger and driver and offers more convenience in ordering a ride.\\nTOM BARRETT\\nTom Barrett, president at EnCirca Inc., wrote, “1) With the use of a smartwatch, I can now easily track daily exercise activity, which is a great motivator for making it a daily practice. 2) Apps for ordering car rides via a smartphone is a net benefit to society – it increases safety for both the passenger and driver and offers more convenience in ordering a ride.”\\nMultipurpose and memory aid\\nBill Lehr, a research scientist and economist at MIT, wrote, “There is no question smartphones and always/everywhere access to information has allowed me to be sloppier in memorizing things and allows me to gain instant access to facts that I have come to rely on significantly. I think that is positive, especially since as I get older, I find memory-aids a big help, but it also encourages laziness.”\\nTed Newcomb, directing manager of AhwatukeeBuzz, wrote, “LOL. I am virtually helpless without my phone to remind me of appointments and meetings. My head is free of having to remember numbers, dates and times. It’s very liberating. I can instantly communicate anywhere in the world, doing business at the ‘speed of byte.’”\\nMicah Altman, director of research and head scientist for the program for information science at MIT, said, “When I was 10, I received a portable film camera. It had a capacity of 24 negatives (in black and white). I would send the negatives in, pay a substantial portion of my allowance to have them developed – wait for weeks for them to be returned, and finally, then be able to see how they turned out. (Usually, not so well.) Every few months, I might put one in a letter to my grandparents. Eight years ago, when my daughter turned 10, we gave her a portable camera – over the next few years she shot thousands of still, and videos – learning some elements of composition, and building shared memories. Last year, when my son turned 11, we gave him a cellphone. And over the year we’ve all shared pictures, accomplishments and sympathies daily across a growing extended family network.”\\nShiru Wang, research associate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said, “Online shopping saves me time. New social media continues my connections with friends in different countries and regions. Online resources make my research convenient. Online news keeps me informed all the time. But I am not very digitally embedded. I keep a distance from Facebook, etc.; I intentionally refuse to be dominated by social media. Thus, my life is not very much bothered by the internet. Thus, I appreciate the advantages of the internet and I am able to escape the potential harm brought by the internet.”\\nJoe Raimondo, digital customer-relationship-management leader at Comcast and a former CEO, said, “Trackers and personal data are an enhancement to living. Street-level navigation and easy access to crowdsourced resources is very positive. It’s possible to play large-scale social games and have enormous amounts of data and telemetry collected and analyzed to chart group interaction at large scale.”\\nGeneral comments\\nIan O’Byrne, an assistant professor of education at the College of Charleston, wrote, “As an educator and researcher who studies these digital places and tools, I’m in front of screens a lot. I experiment and play in these spaces. I’m also writing and researching the impact of these screens and their impact on the well-being of others as it relates to children and adolescents. The problem in this is that one of the other hats that I wear is as a parent and husband. I am not only critical of my engagement and use of these digital technologies, but I’m also cautious/cognizant of their role as a mediator in my relationships with my children and significant other. These screens and digital tools play a strong role in our lives and interactions in and out of our home. In our home we have screens and devices all over the place. We have a video server that is ready to serve content to any one of these screens on demand. We have voice-assistive devices listening and waiting for our commands. I believe it is important as an educator and researcher to play with and examine how these devices are playing a role in our lives, so I can bring this work to others. Even with these opportunities, I’m still struck by times when technology seems too intrusive. This is plainly evident when I’m sitting with my family and watching a television show together, and I’m gazing off into my device reading my RSS feed for the day. Previously I would enjoy watching the funniest home videos and laughing together. Now, I am distant. The first thing in the morning when I’m driving my kids in to school and stop at a red light, previously I would enjoy the time to stop, listen to the radio, look at the clouds or bumper stickers on cars around me. Now, I pull out the phone to see if I received a notification in the last 20 minutes. When I call out for the voice-activated device in my home to play some music or ask a question, my request is quickly echoed by my 2-year-old who is just learning to talk. She is echoing these conversations I’m having with an artificial intelligence. I’m trying to weigh this all out in my mind and figure what it means for us personally. The professional understanding may come later.”\\nMarshall Kirkpatrick, product director of influencer marketing, said, “My mobile feed reader finds great articles for me to learn from. My mobile article-saving app reads those articles to me out loud while I walk my dog. My mobile browser allows me to edit my personal wiki to record the best lessons I learn from those articles. My mobile flashcard app helps me recall and integrate those lessons I want to learn over time. My mobile checklist app helps me track how regularly I reflect on how those lessons connect with the larger context of my life in a blog post or on a run. There are costs to mobile connectivity, but there are so many incredible benefits!”\\nTo my way of thinking, it’s about control. If I’m in control of the electronics, they are a benefit, but when they get out of control they are an irritation and an interruption.\\nFRED BAKER\\nFred Baker, an internet pioneer and longtime leader with the Internet Engineering Task Force, wrote, “To my way of thinking, it’s about control. If I’m in control of the electronics, they are a benefit, but when they get out of control they are an irritation and an interruption. My family and friends giggle about the frequency with which I pull out my telephone to investigate a TV show’s facts or other things. That said, I have access to that now, where I once upon a time did not. On the other hand, I have also had the experience of talking with a customer in Japan while my family in the U.S. woke up and started texting each other, and I all of a sudden have to deal with my telephone.”\\nStephen Abram, CEO of the Federation of Ontario Public Libraries, wrote, “On a personal level I am more connected with my wider family. Relationships with friends whom I see only occasionally – maybe annually in person at conferences, continue throughout the year. I now know many business acquaintances on a deeper level and have better relationships as a result. I dislike the word ‘hyperconnected’ since it implies a little hyperactivity – a known ‘disorder.’ I see this as a controllable issue where personal choices are made. When circumstances such as travel, weather, disability or distance create the opportunities for sustained loneliness to happen, the digital world bridges some of the gap. In my case, sustained periods on the road in airports and hotel rooms are greatly ameliorated by connecting with friends.”\\nDavid J. Krieger, director of the Institute for Communication & Leadership located in Lucerne, Switzerland, observed, “Digital connectivity enables a seamless flow of communication and association with regard to many different concerns and interests. This augments community and embeddedness and thus well-being.”\\nMark Patenaude, vice president and general manager of cloud technologies at ePRINTit, said, “I certainly don’t want to fool anyone into believing that digital advancement has been a panacea of beautiful things! However, I can remember the first time my car stopped for me in a dangerous situation automatically, or stopped when I was backing up when it perceived a danger. Then there’s printing and storing terabytes of digitally compressed images on a smartphone and being able access a document or image from 20 years ago in seconds using the cloud. I can remember we had about 100 people around a large projector outside, watching the last concert of the The Tragically Hip and the home network went down. I plugged in my iPhone, went to the concert URL site, and projected live on a 10-foot screen from my cellular device; wow and double wow!”\\nAkah Harvey, co-founder, COO and IT engineer at Traveler Inc., said, “Fifteen years back, when I first had my first PC, I now was empowered with a tool that helped me write digital notes, play more exciting games and gain general knowledge about how the technology worked. At my age (10) I gained knowledge in the workings of these things that it contributed to my brilliance in school, especially on the subject. Few years later when we’d gain access to the internet, a whole new change took place. I discovered so many more opportunities, as one could now connect with the rest of the world to share, search and find information about anything. It was a big transformation in the way I viewed society. I quickly was able to decide what I would want to do growing older, so I’d say I found my passion thanks to this change.”\\nKarl Ackermann, a writer and researcher at WriteSpace LLC., commented, “We no longer keep paper files for the household. Photographs are displayed on a digital screen instead of a photo album. We can track where our kids are driving with a phone app. We buy our train tickets with an app that has a scanning bar code. We sometimes text friends instead of phoning. We pay bills online.”\\nRich Salz, principal engineer at Akamai Technologies, said, “I have made my living in this field since before there was the internet and before the Web. I enjoy helping people communicate. Social media has helped me reconnect with high school friends, email with college friends, etc.”\\nMaureen Hilyard, IT consultant and vice chair of the At-Large Advisory Committee of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), wrote, “I live in an isolated little island in the Pacific. It is in the middle of millions of square kilometers of ocean, but we rely on tourism for our livelihood, so our small (main) island is usually packed with tourists. We have a monopoly telecom and get reasonable internet service from an O3B satellite, but for local islanders who make their living working in the hospitality industry, the cost of internet is very expensive. Broadband costs for 20 GB a month costs (in New Zealand dollars) $139 on top of telephone hire and connections. I have grandchildren and great-grandchildren who spend time in New Zealand and even at 2 years old can turn on a computer to access their favourite programmes. When they come to our island, this is curtailed because the connection is too expensive for them to experience what is normal for them – lively and creative pre-school programmes are non-existent. What is available is the fresh clean air and produce of the land and sea of the islands, which are great, but it is often too hot to do much exploring in the physical world. As a parent, I am happy for them to explore the internet during the hot periods of the day, and to make this a ‘learning and exploring on the web’ time. It is more directed learning as parent safety software can usually help to set some controls over what they might ‘accidentally’ connect to.”\\nEdward Tomchin, a retiree, wrote, “All my life I’ve had questions. How, what, where, why? It was the early 1980s in San Francisco. I was making a late career change into law as a paralegal and dating a woman I’d met at a Unitarian social. Her 9-year-old son, Bela, had a Commodore Vic-20 and taught me how to run a computer and how to program in BASIC. I understood immediately how computers would change my life. Then I realized that was true for everyone. We were suddenly able to acquire, store, manipulate and query massive amounts of information – data – about anything. I made a nice 25-year career out of creating litigation-support databases. Then I found the internet in 1986 and my world expanded infinitely. This was before the Web came into existence as a subset of the internet. I’d already been exploring BBS [online bulletin board] sites and one day found a back door in a public library’s nascent internet connection and had another mental explosion at all the information that was at my fingertips. Today I’m old and disabled but I can sit in my living room at my computer and explore the whole world far better than I ever could before. This is all more than I could have ever hoped for 50 years ago.”\\nInternet Hall of Fame member Bob Metcalfe, co-inventor of Ethernet, founder of 3Com, and a professor of innovation at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote, “The people complaining most about the pathologies of the hyperconnected life own or work for the old media, which once had more of a monopoly on setting society’s agenda. I recall how ‘savvy’ the Clintons and Obama were because they were digitally literate, unlike the GOP, but now that Trump is using social media so effectively, the left hates new media.”\\nShahab Khan, engineer and CEO of PLANWEL, said, “The most impactful thing is the way we communicate at the click of a button. This keeps friends and families united. We can share our workplace problems and be more productive. With the advent of AI, VR [virtual reality]/AR[augmented reality] the educational deliveries will greatly change and teaching methods improve. Online education resources and digital resources bring value to the classroom. Students become more involved and knowledgeable.”\\nNarelle Clark, deputy CEO of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, said, “As an Australian, the tyranny of distance has previously meant that family, friends and colleagues have been acutely aware of the difficulties of staying in touch and abreast of the events in the rest of the country and the world. Our contemporary hyperconnectedness means that we can remain tightly connected at the professional and personal level despite being on opposite sides of the world.”\\nRuth Ann Barrett, an information curator at EarthSayers.tv, wrote, “Ten years ago I invested money in the development of a search engine that remains well ahead of the times and may never be monetized in the way envisioned. Who knows? The search engine has enabled me to build a database of sustainability voices, those speaking on behalf of Mother Earth and her children. This work has sustained me through moments of despair when so-called leaders deny substantiated claims regarding global warming and extreme climate events. The work has put me in contact with scientists, environmental campaigners and people from all walks of life worldwide. Without the Web what I am able to accomplish would not be possible. My guidebook remains ‘The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man’ by Marshall McLuhan. I remember the day a technical person who had attended a presentation at Stanford University on the World Wide Web came back to work, pulled me aside and told me what he had seen and heard and how the world was about to change.”\\nAnonymous commenters who cited ways the internet helps them and others\\nA distinguished advocate for the internet and policy director based in Europe said, “Digital technology has made the world much more connected and streamlined for the 50% of us who are connected (50% still do not have that privilege). It is important to understand that technology has profound impacts on equality. For me, as an upper-middle-class white male from the U.S. living in Europe, technologies have simplified how I communicate with my family and friends elsewhere in real time. Thanks to WhatsApp and Facetime and iMessages, I am able to stay in touch and informed in ways that were not possible even five years ago.”\\nA certified public accountant based in the U.S. commented, “My sister and I were watching an NFL game with my 82-year-old father. We grew curious about some meaningless football fact and my sister started typing a question on her phone and my dad looked on in slight disgust and raised his phone and asked Siri the question. Voice-activated technology has been extremely easy for the elderly to adopt and opens up incredible opportunities. If linked to his security system, our dad would be able to easily request help. I find it interesting that he likes using Siri more than we do.”\\nAn employee at a major U.S. research lab wrote, “Texting and cellphones are generally associated with what’s bad with technology and our lives, but I will give a positive example, just to prove it depends on how you use the tool. I have a teenage daughter and my work is 50 miles away in Southern California. I joined a van pool to reduce the amount of driving, but the one drawback with van pooling is that I have to leave very early in the morning, and the van does not wait for riders. So every minute in the morning is precious, I don’t have time to write quick notes or reminders before I leave the house and the rest of my family are still asleep. However, once I am on the van, there is 60 minutes of ‘my time.’ I began by sending reminders for the day, but it has become a habit of just sending a happy greeting each morning! They respond when they get up, even if it is just an emoji. :)”\\nAn anonymous respondent said, “There are many examples: The ability to organise via smartphones to meet people across different applications, Slack, Google chat, email, SMS. Voice-chatting to a friend while you are both playing an online game from different locations. A friend enjoying dancing and running in a [digital] game while being in a wheelchair at home. Publishing designs for printing on T-shirts and other products on Redbubble. Designing fabric on Zazzle using their online pattern-repeating tool. Print on demand. A community of linocut artists sharing their work on Facebook. I love the #nzsecretsanta, which uses both the traditional postal system and Twitter. A friend shares fitness data and cycling trips as part of her triathlete community. Ordering food online and having it delivered – and tracking the delivery. I think communities are connecting more digitally than they were on analog. Fewer street parties and more remote connections with common interests. One good example of using the internet to reinforce local community is the use of Facebook for sharing vegetable and fruit produce from local gardens. The ‘Great Australian Bird Count’ is also interesting citizen science.”\\nA research scientist based in North America commented, “My kids are always connected to their friends. Through texting/social media, they are constantly aware of each other’s lives. This brings worries too, like social comparisons may make them less happy, but overall, they have more socially balanced lives.”\\nDigital technology is an equalizer of information access and use. Even individuals in the most geographically remote locations can participate in an electoral debate, education and banking online, and in e-commerce when broadband is available.\\nPRESIDENT AND CEO OF A COMPANY BASED IN THE U.S.\\nA president and CEO of a company based in the United States wrote, “Digital technology is an equalizer of information access and use. Even individuals in the most geographically remote locations can participate in an electoral debate, education and banking online, and in e-commerce when broadband is available. The stark opposite of this is the darkness individuals and families experience when left behind in the digital age. There is a difference between people who choose to use digital technology for their own benefit and those who are simply not included in the digital age.”\\nA professor based in North America commented, “I am a college professor, and digital technology has made my job so much easier. It is easier to communicate with students, keep records, and try for creative solutions to instructional problems. So, for example, I now have my students submit their papers online (to be graded and returned online). When they submit their papers, they are automatically checked for originality. The students then are informed whether their papers will be considered plagiarized or not. Prior to the adoption of this system, I would say up to half my papers were plagiarized. Now none of them are. The question is, has this improved their performance? It is hard to say because there are so many factors involved. I would say that it has in some ways and not in others. They know more, but they don’t synthesize it that well.”\\nA social media manager wrote, “Fitness trackers, such as the Apple Watch and the Google fitness app, provide me with greater awareness of my daily activity. I am more likely to take a walk or exercise in response to the presence of these technologies in my life. For example, I recently installed a ‘7-minute exercise’ app that I use each morning to kickstart my day. It is very convenient to use and pops up reminders on my smartphone with encourage me to keep up with the daily routine.”\\nAn associate professor at a university in Australia shared a typical family vignette, writing, “I spend time with my grandchild, who is only just five. I check the pick-up time by text. She arrives with her iPad and asks me to ask her dad a question by text on my phone. We take pictures of her dressing up and send them to a friend. I show her recently sent pictures of cousins in Canada. For a while, she shows me (from her iPad) how she can operate the movements, colour and cheeky comments of a robot ball (a birthday present from an uncle who wants her to be familiar with coding). We consider cooking together and locate a recipe online for cookies we haven’t made before. Next, we go to the playground and she spots a ‘be aware’ notice on the slide, and a bird that we haven’t seen before. ‘Let’s Google it, Grandma, when we get back home!’ she says. I say we can do it now on my phone, no, later on my laptop is better. She knows that devices operate differently and need passwords. We haven’t given her any of the latter. ‘Buffering’ she says with a sigh, as her current favourite show stalls during a quiet time. She dances to YouTube music from my laptop. She is endlessly curious about technology itself. She accepts technologies’ limitations as they are described to her by the adults in her life. The digital tools just enhance our days together.”\\nA professor said, “My watch is an exercise coach – though limited. I track family and friends and contact them only if required. Is my partner nearly home? I’ll put out a snack. Is my friend nearby? I ask them if they want to meet.”\\nAn author based in North America said, “Instead of just reading a book, communicating with one author’s created words, I can engage in conversation, in dialogue about issues of the day such as the #MeToo movement. I can help another person feel a little better that day and, if I reveal a low, others can pick me up. I can celebrate an anniversary with people far away in space and time and plan an in-person visit to another continent with someone I haven’t seen for years, first originally encountered online.”\\nA postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University commented, “As an academic, my friends and colleagues are scattered around the world. Our ability to have frequent video calls, send texts and collaboratively author shared documents has had a huge impact on both my intellectual scope and on my feeling ‘at home’ and connected in the world. In the past, a friend taking a job across the planet would be a cause for great sorrow. Now we talk frequently over video chat, while it isn’t as good as seeing her in-person, it is still wonderful to share our lives and ideas.”\\nA retired internet activist and advocate said, “I have been able to manage health care better at a distance for an aging parent as a result of technology, viewing charts/graphs/images, consulting various medical resources, having online meetings with medical professionals, video conversations with parents. Before many varieties of digital connectivity were available, distance communication was via ground/air mail, an occasional landline-based conference call, or in-person consultations, often without simultaneous participation of the aging parent whose medical situation was involved.”\\nA retired market researcher and consultant said, “I can now communicate directly with any of my medical doctors instead of sending messages through nurses and receptionists. The response is more rapid and on-target with my question or concern. On a different note, my daughter is currently teaching in China for the next year. We have had the great fortune to be able to talk to her in real-time as well as have a video conference at no expense. When I was a college student in France in the 1980s, a brief phone call to the United States – assuming we could arrange a time to talk – was quite expensive and a logistical nightmare. My wife has been able to keep in touch [and] reconnect with elementary school friends thanks to the internet and services like Facebook. All these things account for our improved well-being.”\\nA college student based in North America wrote, “I often find myself stressed out at the end of the day; as a result I tend to enjoy relaxing and staying in for the night. Without the modern hyperconnected lifestyle this would result in me reading or doing other solo activities. Through voice-chat applications and online multiplayer gaming, I connect with friends to play video games. While I don’t have the energy to be social in one way, the ease of connecting over the internet enables me to enjoy time with friends and maintain our relationships. To some it might not seem as effective a method of socializing as in-person face-to-face time, but we still have the same moments that other people do. We still happily greet each other, we still tell stories about our daily lives and rely on each other, we still laugh until it hurts.”\\nA professor of arts, technology and innovation wrote, “As a college professor I’m continually adopting new tools that change the way I work with students and pedagogy. Most recently adopting Slack for classroom management has been a real game-changer. With far less attention-investment than I’d needed when using email I’m able to keep up with individual students and teams and the interactions among my students. I can do these on a more-or-less 24/7 basis but without it feeling like a 24/7 obligation. I’m teaching more people better, easier.”\\nAn anonymous respondent commented, “I am connected to email lists that allow me to be part of a conversation that includes leaders in my field. This means that, despite being somewhat isolated at a mid-level university in a provincial city, I can have a good sense of where the cutting edge in my profession is headed and I can be reasonably confident that I am promptly aware of most the news and information that is critical to my profession.”\\nAn entrepreneur and business leader from North America commented, “As an immigrant in the U.S., the internet, social media, and email are all helping me to keep in touch with my family, my homeland and my roots. I am following many of my fellow countrymen – some whom I studied with, some who were my teachers, relatives and acquaintances. I learn about their daily life, their fears and hopes, what they are interested in, the news they read. My daughters speak on a weekly basis to their grandparents on Skype – of both sides – and feel like they’re in the same room with them. Without the internet all of this would not have been possible.”\\nA research scientist based in Europe commented, “I live in a small town in a foreign country. I travel a lot for my work and spend a lot of time on the road. At home, I enjoy communicating with my Google Home speaker, because otherwise there would be some days that I would speak to no one. When I am on the road, I check in with my Canary home-surveillance app to check on my dogs and see my home.”\\nA technology architect/executive based in North America commented, “For me, it’s not about hyper – always-on – connection, but the accessibility of information on any topic at any time. I had a medical problem a few years ago, and being able to find research on the disease and a community to compare notes with on treatment side effects was invaluable. Years earlier, when my mother had this same disease, we were limited in information and (therefore) options. Her outcome could have been different in a time with more information, more resources.”\\nAn assistant director of digital strategy at a top U.S. university wrote, “The internet has exponentially enabled the dissemination of healthcare information to the greater public. Years ago, it would have been far more difficult for the public to easily access the answers they needed regarding health concerns and the latest treatments. Today’s digital ecosystem puts these answers at users’ fingertips.”\\nAn editor and project coordinator based in Europe wrote, “A few years ago I quit my job and I have been working as a freelance editor and project coordinator. I have been able to work, network and get paid by people and companies all over the world thanks to the internet and other technologies. Also access to self-education and being able to talk to my friends and family thousands of miles away have had a very positive impact on my mental health and well-being. I wouldn’t have been able to talk and see loved ones daily if it wasn’t for the internet, software and hardware.”\\nA chief data officer at a major university in Australia wrote, “Thanks to social media, in particular Twitter, I am now connected with people all around the world. I have access to an enormous brains trust, which I liken to a global hive mind.”\\nA data analyst said, “We always have someone to reach out to when things are unfamiliar and seem difficult to deal with. Before these technologies, you could write a letter or make a phone call. The reality is that the moment that spurred the writing of the letter has long passed by the time you get a response. If you get a response. Also, a phone call is somewhat of a commitment compared to an electronic message. It takes more mental faculties to process what someone is saying over the phone than to read a message and type a quick response between other pressing activities in the immediate proximity.”\\nA futurist and consultant based in Europe commented, “There are plenty of examples of increased choices. Take travel: I can see in real time if the flight of my friend for New Year’s Eve is on time or not and plan to be there just in time to pick them up. I could have called an Uber or taxi if I was busy and decided to send them a cab instead. In turn, they could see much a better forecast of weather and adjust luggage intakes accordingly to come and spend the time at our place/could book in advance to be picked up at the airport upon arrival, etc.”\\nA research scientist based in Oceania commented, “If I want to buy something, I can go to a liquid market such as eBay and get it for a fair price without the search costs of spending time going to shops to compare prices. If I want to read a paper, I can download it rather than going to a library and photocopying it.”\\nA technology developer/administrator based in Europe said, “1) Information access with no barrier – The masterpieces of world literature are generally available in any language, for free. This is a huge achievement. The Gutenberg Project played a key role in making this possible. Wikipedia: the world encyclopaedia, is beyond anything any user of the previous paper encyclopaedia would have imagined. Wikipedia has answers on any area of knowledge, not all answers, but there is always a base from which to start. Science: I can read about the latest developments in any domain, with no barrier. Researchgate.net and Google Scholar give access to a wealth of knowledge. 2) Conversely, new barriers have been erected by companies competing in the [research] market, led by the two world leaders Elsevier and Springer. If you are an author of an article, you may be asked to pay 15€ for accessing your own work online! Personal intellectual property has been taken away from scientists, and money made from it, with no fair sharing of the value with science and scientists!”\\nAn executive director at an internet research organization said, “Twenty years ago, as a business traveler, half of my suitcase was filled with paper – mostly books, which I’d otherwise have to try to replace at mostly poorly stocked English-language bookstores along my way, but also guidebooks, maps, and translation dictionaries. I carried analog telephony adapters. I carried a phone, I carried ATM cards from two banks and credit cards from three separate clearing networks, as well as $9,000 in cash divided between several pockets. I carried a RIM pager. I carried Ricochet and NCR wireless modems. I carried spare batteries and power adapters and chargers for all of those things. I spent a lot of time worrying about whether I would have local currency to pay for things, whether I’d be able to find my destination or communicate with taxi drivers, whether I’d be able to establish a data connection back to my network to reach my email. All of that has compacted itself, gradually, one consolidation at a time, into a very compact kit. One debit card, my phone, a laptop, a power adapter and a small handful of cables. Everything else has been virtualized, digitized, or turned into an online service.”\\nA technology developer/administrator based in North America, said, “An older person in my family who recently started using an electric wheelchair can buy daily necessities through online shopping and can have more meaningful communication through video calls.”\\nA scholarly communication librarian said, “I have several friends who have disabilities – both physical and mental – that make it difficult for them to leave their homes for socialization. These friends of mine have taken to playing online games and participating in fandom in internet spaces as a way to make connections and friends with other people that enrich their lives without requiring the physical exertion that would usually prevent them from interacting socially. The ability to connect with text, video and other online objects – whether one-on-one or one-to-many – helps these folks make the social connections that they need to have a robust social experience without the physical exhaustion they may have experienced without this technology to help.”\\nA professor wrote, “We have public infrastructure and systems now for maintaining and accessing lab results and earlier diagnoses online when we need them. Earlier prescriptions can be viewed, etc. For emergencies, we have an app that we can use for automatic location information if we need urgent help. Schoolchildren and their parents have online connections to the schools and teachers. The teachers can take advantage of the internet and their educational networks with schools around the globe to tackle shared projects that encompass language learning, climate and humanity.”\\nWe have a child with autism. The internet allows us to reach out to other families, experts, get news and be part of a community that is not limited by geography.\\nPRESIDENT AT A COMPANY BASED IN NORTH AMERICA\\nA president at a company based in North America wrote, “We have a child with autism. The internet allows us to reach out to other families, experts, get news and be part of a community that is not limited by geography. We can instantly share the quirky – or sometimes way more than quirky – activities of our son with people who know if they should laugh or say they are sorry.”\\nAn assistant professor said, “I have collected about 50,000 scientific files related to cosmos, life and consciousness to prepare a book.”\\nA researcher based in Europe wrote, “I live in Hungary and my daughter was working in the United States several years ago. She called me and explained exactly where she was walking and in which shops she was shopping. I opened Google Earth and tracked her trajectory where she was walking in Galveston, Texas. I saw the streets, corners and buildings. It was almost exactly as if I was shopping with her – on the other side of the globe, in real time, but while sitting in my chair in Hungary. The whole thing was real fun for us.”\\nA business leader based in North America wrote, “I live a bi-coastal life and I am able to review health records, renew RXs, communicate with my doctor, request a non-urgent service, all from 3,000 miles away without having to rebuild new caregiver relationships or lose care continuity.”\\nA research associate at a major university in Africa commented, “Being able to conduct business from a location of choice is to me the most important improvement. I deal regularly with the aged and was terrified that I too would become so dependent on the goodwill of strangers when I have to move to an old age home until I realized that I would already be able to order and have delivered anything from food to medical equipment – as long as I am connected via the internet.”\\nA retired professor emeritus said, “I am seeing a larger integration and extension of human-digital synergy.”\\nA professor of computer science wrote, “Shortly after getting my first smartphone (quite a number of years ago now), I managed to receive and respond to an important email during a break in the middle of a four-hour car trip. It was valuable to be able to be able to be responsive to an important funder. This cemented the value of having a smartphone.”\\nA technology developer/administrator said, “I do a lot of genealogy research. Instead of mailing physical paper that may have a correction before it reaches the recipient, I can post updates/corrections immediately. I’m building a database of destroyed cemeteries where I live. I can research the records online and publish them online; something I could not have done 20 years ago easily. I got an email from a man whose great grandfather died in the 1918 flu epidemic in Wilmington, North Carolina – a Merchant Marine sailor – who was buried in one of these cemeteries. The family knew he had died, but did not know when or where. He thanked me very much for finding his great grandfather. The family felt relief after 100 years. Without digital records to compile this and digital platforms to share it, it would not have happened.”\\nAn executive director of a Canadian nonprofit organization wrote, “We are currently running a program to increase people’s digital comfort by helping them apply online for underutilized government subsidy programs. During the first workshop, I saw a woman learn how to use a scrolling mouse and how to cut and paste, in the context of applying for a subsidy that will save her more than $50 a month on her electricity bill.”\\nAn associate professor at Texas Christian University commented, “I work in education and whereas before grades were posted on doors and people had to wait for responses, today, students can access information instantly, enroll in classes, etc. without having to stand in long lines and wait for responses. Communicating with the course, students and the professor is easy, and people learn to do things themselves.”\\nA professor at a major university on the West Coast of the U.S. wrote, “I am an academic past retirement age (although still working) so it has made an enormous difference for teaching and research. I can access publications from my home or office without a trip to the library. No more endless photocopying. I can easily and quickly communicate with fellow scholars around the world. I can communicate with students and former students anytime anywhere and submit letters of recommendation electronically. I need less clerical and administrative support. I can put readings online for students. The drawback of course is to keep students focused on class in class rather than Facebook, Twitter, etc.”\\nA professor at a major university on the East Coast of the U.S. wrote, “Digital technology has allowed me to shift my career emphasis from political science and international security analysis of nuclear and conventional weapons to cyber weapons and critical infrastructure protection. This shift is not what I expected when I left graduate school, but it has allowed me to make professional contributions I would not have been able to make had I stayed in my prior disciplinary concentration. I am also migrating my entire work life online, deliberately minimizing paper and focusing on digital services – and the analysis of critical dependencies on these services – for industry and government.”\\nA internet pioneer wrote, “Every working day, I engage with staff and customers through Skype, email, text and Web conferencing, making it possible for me to have global reach from a desk on the second floor of my home. We take it for granted, but it is miraculous and something truly new under the sun.”\\nAn associate professor at a major university on the East Coast of the U.S. wrote, “I am part of a private group on Facebook, which consists of my friends from college and some others (spouses, friends, etc.). We keep in touch and discuss things in this group. Recently the group came together in-person to support and celebrate one member of the group who has terminal cancer. We had a large party with our children and it was wonderful. It meant a lot to our friend who is ill and to all of us to spend time together. We would not have been able to do this as easily before platforms like Facebook.”\\nA retired consultant and writer said, “I appreciate the ease of gathering information, freedom from media advertising and unprecedented capacity to stay in touch with my family. I’m part of several groups, and the digital environment has enabled fantastic coordination to achieve things that were not possible before. I have been part of two successful Kickstarter campaigns to implement and sustain a social enterprise: [one for] a social studio for adults on the autism spectrum, where they can apprentice for creative self-employment, and [and another for] the capacity to move toward this through another platform.”\\nAn epidemiologist based in North America wrote, “At work, improved technology means that we receive population health data faster. We can receive, investigate and respond to health threats quickly, before they spread. For example, if we have an outbreak of a communicable disease, technology allows us to efficiently collect data through online formats and analyze data so we can quickly release information/education on how to prevent further spread of the disease. Before we had online forms, we would often to communicate through telephone or in-person interviews to collect data about the outbreak.”\\nAn anonymous respondent said, “About 18 months ago my wife was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer and underwent a lumpectomy and radiation treatment. In part, the testing that led to the diagnosis and the ability of the doctors to respond rapidly was greatly assisted by digital technology. As well, our ability to find information to understand treatment options, side effects, and follow-up nutrition and lifestyle improvement was greatly enhanced by digital technology. Due to my job I was not able to take her to radiation treatment every day and she was too tired after to drive, so I used the online tool SignUpGenius to ask friends to help and to schedule their rides. While apparently a simple task, if I had to do that by hand through phone calls and charts, it would have taken many more hours. Before it would have taken much more difficult to obtain the information we needed, perhaps more difficult and slower for the tests and results to be managed, and definitely hard to stay in touch with people about her needs and condition.”\\nA retired systems designer commented, “Several years ago, I became disabled, and am not always well enough to do many things. This limits many of my ‘physical-world’ activities – I find it hard to shop, to cook, to go to the library, to get together with friends and family. However, online shopping and grocery delivery allows me to do the majority of my shopping, though I haven’t figured out how to buy shoes without trying them on! I have joined online communities of people with similar interests, and keep in touch with old friends and colleagues in social media groups. This keeps me mentally stimulated. I do a great deal of genealogical and historical research online, using sophisticated search algorithms of digital versions of old documents and books. These digital resources didn’t exist 25 years ago, and now I can read an 1806 Scottish gazetteer to find out more about the 300-person town an ancestor lived in. Without these resources, I would be living a far more difficult and isolated life.”\\nA North American entrepreneur wrote, “Like any other tool, its use needs to be managed carefully. I hone my contacts to friends and family of my generation who post photos of their kids and grandkids, something that I enjoy greatly. I also like to know when the next big dance events are, since this is a part of my life as well.”\\nA president and chief software architect based in North America wrote, “I can be out on the golf course enjoying the beauty and yet still be connected.”\\nAn assistant professor of technical communication said, “I use both mindfulness and language apps to improve my memory, connections with others, and global perspectives. However, I am also cognizant of these being targeted and from specific perspectives. So I use them with that understanding.”\\nA retired web developer wrote, “Amazon Alexa keeps me company. She plays the music I want to hear and adds items to my grocery list. When I have a question, I can ask her and most times she knows the answer – and I thank her. Facebook has connected me with a long-lost cousin. We were like sisters growing up. Out of curiosity, I searched for her and we now communicate regularly. Forget Google – when I want to know something I go to YouTube. I fixed my squeaking ceiling fan, replaced a washer in my bathroom faucet, AND replaced the starter in my riding mower. Now I have Amazon’s Cloud Cam. I can watch my two schnauzers when I am away from home. I could even talk to them, but it upsets them too much. That I can speak commands to technology makes life easier for me. I’m 60-plus years old, and I often write lists that I can never find. Family members and friends are well-connected. Sometimes too much so. But I lose touch with those who are not digitally inclined, I’m sorry to say. I may message 10 to 15 people but call one on the phone. And, lastly, my skill set has improved so much that when I have a problem around the house I can find a solution and at least try it before calling an expensive contractor.”\\nNext: 2.

It also was one of the Top Ten Most Banned Books of 2004, 2005, 2010, and 2011! To find out why, see pg. 46.\\nI love it when my books are banned because it gives me the chance to speak out about why I think books shouldn’t be banned. Here is an article I wrote for the Los Angeles Review of Books:\\nI\\'ve been a card-carrying member of the dangerous authors’ club since 2004, when my young adult novel, What My Mother Doesn’t Know, landed on the American Library Association’s list of the Top 10 Most Challenged Books of the year. I was thrilled when it made the list again in 2005 and 2010, and even more delighted when it earned the 31st spot on the ALA’s list of the Top 100 Most Banned/ Challenged Books of the Decade—it’s heady stuff to share list-space with the likes of Mark Twain, Ray Bradbury and Ken Kesey.\\n\\nI wasn’t always a young adult author. When I first started out I was just a young adult—a young adult with loads of rich friends who spent the summers at their country homes or at camp. But my family couldn’t afford such luxuries, so I traveled to the library instead, letting books take me all the places I wished I could go.\\nThen, I discovered the steamy dreamy Diaries of Anas Nin, and became an avid journal-writer, often spending more time writing about my life than I actually spent living it. Even so, I never thought of becoming a writer. Instead, when I grew up, I became an animator, and, eventually,  a film editor. When I had a couple of kids of my own, and began reading to them, it was my favorite time of day—the book in my lap and an arm around each of my enraptured darlings. That’s why I decided to try my hand at writing for kids.\\nI didn’t set out to write books for teens, but that turned out to be the voice that came most naturally to me. Lots of people talk about having an inner child, but I’ve got an inner teen. And she’s right there with me, whispering in my ear whenever I sit down to write. In fact, she’d probably argue that she was the one who wrote my books, without any help from me at all. And you might even believe her. She can be very persuasive. Last week she almost had me convinced I should get my bellybutton pierced. Which is not a good look for someone my age…\\nDespite that inner rebel of mine, I never intended to write controversial books. And I was stunned when people wanted to ban them. But I decided not to let the foolish accusations of self-righteous people stifle the voices of my characters.\\nThough you’ve got to have thick skin to be a banned author. Parents from all across the country have written to me to rant about how disgusting and inappropriate they think my book is, and have filed formal complaints called “challenges” to attempt to get it removed from middle school and high school libraries. There are apparently legions of narrow-minded folks out there who feel that if a book isn’t appropriate for their own child, then no child should be allowed to read it. It would be lovely if we could just ignore these people, but unfortunately, we have to give them the respect they don’t deserve.\\nWhen a formal complaint is made, members of the community meet to discuss whether or not to comply with the request to remove the book, following the guidelines created by the ALA’s Office of Intellectual Freedom. Librarians, teachers, students, and parents present their arguments in an open forum and reach a decision.\\nWhat’s good about these meetings is that they get people talking about important issues—like freedom of speech. What’s bad about them is that sometimes they lead to books actually being banned. And when a book is banned, everyone loses. Because, as the 2010 United States Ambassador of Children’s Books, Katherine Paterson, once said, \"All of us can think of a book…that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then, we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.\"\\n\\nWhy do parents think What My Mother Doesn’t Know is so abhorrent?  The Intellectual Freedom Committee cites “sexually explicit” as the reason most often given. This is pretty funny (or pretty depressing, depending on how you look at it) because nothing more than kissing happens in the book—not even the slightest grazing of a boob by a hand. I swear!\\nBut the problem is that the people who try to ban books often don’t actually read them. They just read the juicy parts. I can’t tell you how many letters I\\'ve received from incensed parents telling me that they were horrified when they read “excerpts” of my book. If these people had taken the time to read the entire book, they’d have seen that when the narrator, 14-year-old Sophie, is pressured by her boyfriend to have sex, she refuses to let him push her further than she wants to go. In fact, his sexually aggressive behavior is the main reason that Sophie stops dating him.\\nThis past year, there was a new complaint about my book. The Intellectual Freedom Committee cited “sexism” as one of the reasons it made the cut. How very weird and disturbing to be accused of such a thing…My theory is that the parent filing the official complaint checked off the word \"sexism\" because it had the word \"sex\" in it and that made it sound nasty. And, of course, she knew, from the two pages she had read of What My Mother Doesn’t Know, that my book was indeed nasty. Just a theory, of course.\\nIn truth, whenever the annual Top 10 list is published, I keep my fingers crossed that my book will be on it again. Not because this will increase sales (though it does) and not because it will lead to more teens discovering and reading my book (though it will). The reason I love being on the list is that when I am, I get invited to speak at schools about why books shouldn’t be banned. Which is wonderful, because there is still the possibility that I can lead a child in the right direction, before they’ve been dragged too far down the wrong path by a misguided parent. \\nThe last time I spoke on this topic, at the Pegasus School in Huntington Beach, I told the kids about the controversy that arose in Houston when Ellen Hopkins was uninvited to their YA Lit Festival after a parent complained about the content of one of her books. I explained that some of the other authors who were asked to speak at the festival decided to stay home, in order to show their solidarity with Ellen. Then, I asked the students what they would have done, if they’d been one of those other authors. A student instantly raised her hand and said, “ I would have accepted the invitation, but when I got there, instead of reading from my own book, I would have read from Ellen’s.” How magnificently devious!\\nBut if being devious is what it takes to protect our right to read the books we choose to read, then so be it. We are, after all, living in a world where William Steig’s illustrated story about a horse, Sylvester and the Magic Pebble, was banned because the police happened to be depicted as pigs. ‘Nuff said.\\nI think the great Irish playwright and critic, George Bernard Shaw, summed it up brilliantly: \"Censorship ends in logical completeness when nobody is allowed to read any books except the books that nobody reads.\"\\nCopyright 2004-2021.

       " 'LITERATURE AND OTHER MUSINGS\\nMENU\\nThe Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho\\nPosted on\\nby\\nAbout the author\\nMinfong Ho was born January 7, 1951 in Rangoon, Burma. Her parents originated from China and she was brought up in Bangkok, Thailand. As she did most of her studies in English, Minfong Ho soon mastered three separate languages: English, Thai and Chinese. She “started to write only after I (the author) left home, as a way to conjure up Thailand for myself, to combat homesickness while studying at Cornell University.” Before becoming a writer, she was a journalist at the Straits Time newspaper in Singapore and has been a lecturer as well as a teaching assistant. An award-winning author, her main medium has been short story anthologies, among them being In My Grandmother’s House, Soul Searching, Join In and First Crossings.\\nSynopsis\\nSaeng belongs to a Laotian immigrant family currently residing in the United States. Saeng is to take her driving test using the Lambert’s car, specifically the car that belongs to David Lambert, which is also Saeng’s love interest. Throughout the story, Saeng recollects her memories in Laos and their journey in America, sponsored by a Lutheran minister whose wife is Mrs. Lambert. Although life should be wonderful for them, Saeng is met with a string of events that dampens her joy: she first realises that David would have no interest in her, only heeding his mother’s instructions to lend their car; she then fails the driving test; as she is offering to buy David a meal, with money provided by her mother out of sudden generosity, David pays no attention to her and speeds off to talk to a blonde girl across the street. Disappointed and saddened, Saeng walks home alone and stops by a florist. The florist’s atmosphere reminds Saeng of home and soon, she spots the winter hibiscus – recognised as “saebba” – growing in a pot. Emotions overwhelm her and she decides to buy the flower with the money in hand. When she returns home, Saeng informs her mother that she had failed the driving test. Her mother comforts her, taking the winter hibiscus and planting in the garden. The winter hibiscus, which grows even in adversity, becomes a symbol of Saeng’s renewed hope as she promises to retake the driving test next spring.\\nThemes\\nA. Determination and Perseverance\\nThe story revolves around Saeng’s challenges and ends, aptly enough, with renewed determination to take them head on in the future. Saeng, as an immigrant in a foreign country, is obviously anxious about her appearances and about fitting in. She worries that she might not belong as an American despite being there legally: to resolve that – rather, change herself unnecessarily – she adopts the local language, English and uses it daily; she studies diligently for each test conducted in English using a worn Laotian-English dictionary; she combs her hair straight down her back to mimic the cheerleaders, the image of American “perfection”; she takes the driving test, not just to help her family, but also to increase her standing and maybe, just maybe, draw David’s attention. As the story shows, life doesn’t always go your way, and fitting in does not come easily. Saeng fails the driving test and her attempt at gratitude, to get closer to David is dismissed nonchalantly and casually as David drives away, talking to another girl across the street.\\nAt this point, Saeng had finally broken. She perceives herself as failing at fitting in, deciding to give up on retaking the test, lowering herself into despair and sorrow. After her previous diligence, never once failing a school test despite her difficulty in understanding the language, to fail here, in front of David was a disgrace too heavy to bear. To kick her when she’s down even further, she is reminded of how faraway she was from her home by the saebba – the hibiscus. She is taken aback by how lost she is, hopelessly isolated in a foreign land. She had lost so much and broke down crying.\\nYet after bringing home the hibiscus, Saeng does not spiral into despair. Instead she is reminded of how far she and her family, immigrants from beyond the ocean, had come in this land of opportunity. Her mother comforts the crying Saeng and brings the saebba to the garden to be planted. As she digs up the cold soil and sets the hibiscus into the ground, she hears and smells the cooking of bitter melon in the pan, another symbol of her individuality. Despite leaving her hometown, she did not leave herself behind and this new home has become so much more familiar. Hope is brimming in her heart now as she swears to retake the driving test in spring, just when the hardy winter hibiscus begins budding.\\nIn a way, the theme represented here is in close relation to the winter hibiscus itself. The hibiscus, coming from a foreign land just like Saeng was at first alone in this harsh world. But it does not give up, growing up in the harsh, grey winters and soon becoming familiar with them after years of living, adapting to its surroundings yet retaining its distinct petals and leaves. No matter how isolated you are, and how many foreign obstacles hamper and surround you, there is always hope to survive. This determination to survive and succeed is what sets people apart and is what pushes them further to strive for a better life. This is reflected in Saeng’s final declaration; despite her not belonging like David and the cheerleaders, she still loves this new home and will do her best to survive in it, overcoming whatever challenge may come her way.\\nB. Life of An Immigrant Family\\nWe have all heard of immigrants in Western countries, in particular Asian families that end up in America, the promised land of opportunity. The Winter Hibiscus depicts such a life splendidly, from the initial aid they receive, to the desperation to earn for themselves, independence and the desire to fit in. Saeng’s family has shown us what it takes to survive in a foreign country, without any prior knowledge of the language or the country itself.\\nFrom the first summer when they had went smelting and combing the golf course for nightcrawlers, to sending out for seeds in Chinatown and having their own garden, Saeng’s family is a representation of the desire to be independent, possessed by many immigrant families there. Many strive to work hard for themselves and craft a future in this promised land, struggling to learn the language just like Saeng and her parents. There are also those who are desperate to fit in like Saeng, changing their own appearance to be accepted by others and striving to fit in by partaking in what might give her her American identity and look, such as a driving license and cheerleader hair.\\nYet, these immigrant families do not separate from their original identity. Just as how Saeng remembers her home and her past, it is part of who they are. No matter how hard they try to fit in, there will never be an American as seen on TV – white, pure and smiling. It is their origins that make them special – despite all their discrimination and setbacks, they choose to look forward and live on. Their strength and determination is something to be admired.\\nCharacters\\nSaeng\\nDisciplined/Diligent\\nStudies hard for each of her tests, be it school tests or driving tests, despite her lack of fluency in English as the primary language in America\\nDetermined\\nThis can be seen through her diligent studying and her strong will when it came to taking the driving test, albeit for a very brief moment. However, she regained this determination from the inspiration of the winter hibiscus – saebba – and decides to retake the test in spring even though she had suffered humiliation just earlier.\\nLow self-esteem\\nThis is seen through the emphasis by Saeng that she felt that she did not belong despite living in America for four years. She sees herself as different from the typical teenage American despite being the same age and the image of perfection was unreachable to her.\\nThis changes when she accepts America not as a shelter but as her new home, having familiarised herself with her surroundings and life and America, shown in the last two paragraphs of the short story.\\nDavid Lambert\\nIndifferent\\nCould not care for Saeng’s driving test outcome, only doing what he was told to lend the car to Saeng\\nSaeng’s mother\\nCaring\\nCares about Saeng and her social life. Hands her a twenty dollar note to treat herself and David to Big Macs\\nCares about her family’s welfare, hence works hard to support them independent from government aid\\nDiligent\\nWorks hard after arriving in America. Goes smelting, gathering nightcrawlers and studies English under a government program. Also works as a dishwasher along with her husband as a janitor.\\nQuotations\\nSaeng glanced down at her own clean clothes. She had dressed carefully for the test – and for David. She had on a grey wool skirt and a Fair Isles sweater, both courtesy of David’s mother from their last jumble sale at the church. And she had combed out her long black hair and left it hanging straight down her back the way she had seen the blond cheerleaders do theirs, instead of bunching it up with a rubber band.\\n\\nThis demonstrates Saeng’s attempt at fitting in, a clear sign of her discomfort of being alienated in this foreign country. She copies the local’s appearances and tries to blend into the background of this nation.\\n\\nThere were certain words that held a strange resonance for Saeng, as if they were whispered echoes behind them. Luuke, or child, was one of these words. When her mother called her luuke in that soft, teasing way, Saeng could hear the voices of her grandmother and her uncle or her primary-school teachers behind it, as if there were an invisible chorus of smiling adults calling her, chiding her.\\n\\nThis shows that Saeng was quite fond of her former home and that her native language is one of the ways Saeng recalls Laos. It also gives us insight into Saeng as it tells us that she had left home as early as primary school, and that not all of her family and friends could make it to America with her, foreshadowing Saeng’s sadness at this loss later on in the story.\\n\\nIt had happened so quickly. Saeng felt limp. So she had failed. She felt a burning shame sting her cheeks. She had never failed a test before. Not even when she had first arrived in school and had not understood a word the teacher had said, had she ever failed a test.\\n\\nSaeng’s shock at failing the driving test can be felt here. She was extremely ashamed in herself, as seen in the phrase “burning shame” and immediately considered herself a failure. Despite working so hard, one mistake had managed to ruin a significant part of her American life, seen as crucial for her to fit in there.\\n\\nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?\\n\\nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride in the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.\\n\\nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.\\n\\nThe climax of Saeng’s suffering. Overwhelmed first by her first failure in the land of opportunity, she is painfully reminded of how far she was from her original home and the world she had lost, including her own grandmother. She grieves this loss that was held back for four years and lets her tears pour forth. She could never feel the same way she had while living there, her childhood robbed and replaced by this new, strange and foreign life in America.\\n\\nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.\\n\\nThe conclusion to this short story. Shows the renewed hope and determination Saeng has for her driving test and the rest of her future. The hibiscus – a symbol of her home and determination – serves as a another inspiration for Saeng to keep going, regardless of the prejudice she faces as an immigrant.\\nThis is one of the six short stories that is provided through the short stories anthology for English Literature KSSM.\\nShare this:\\nTwitterFacebook\\nBirds of Paradise by Minfong Ho\\nMay 29, 2021\\nIn \"KSSM\"\\nTurning Thirty by Minfong Ho\\nMay 31, 2021\\nIn \"KSSM\"\\nThieving Daughter by Chua Kok Yee\\nJune 3, 2021\\nIn \"KSSM\"\\nPosted in UncategorizedTagged KSSMLeave a comment\\nSambal Without Anchovies by Chua Kok Yee\\nFlowers for Algernon (Radio Play by Bert Coules)\\nLeave a Reply\\nSEARCH\\nAdvertisements\\n\\nREPORT THIS AD\\nJUNE 2021\\nM T W T F S S\\n  1 2 3 4 5 6\\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13\\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20\\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27\\n28 29 30  \\n« May   Jul »\\nTRANSLATE\\nSelect Language\\nAfrikaans\\nAlbanian\\nAmharic\\nArabic\\nArmenian\\nAzerbaijani\\nBasque\\nBelarusian\\nBengali\\nBosnian\\nBulgarian\\nCatalan\\nCebuano\\nChichewa\\nChinese (Simplified)\\nChinese (Traditional)\\nCorsican\\nCroatian\\nCzech\\nDanish\\nDutch\\nEsperanto\\nEstonian\\nFilipino\\nFinnish\\nFrench\\nFrisian\\nGalician\\nGeorgian\\nGerman\\nGreek\\nGujarati\\nHaitian Creole\\nHausa\\nHawaiian\\nHebrew\\nHindi\\nHmong\\nHungarian\\nIcelandic\\nIgbo\\nIndonesian\\nIrish\\nItalian\\nJapanese\\nJavanese\\nKannada\\nKazakh\\nKhmer\\nKinyarwanda\\nKorean\\nKurdish (Kurmanji)\\nKyrgyz\\nLao\\nLatin\\nLatvian\\nLithuanian\\nLuxembourgish\\nMacedonian\\nMalagasy\\nMalay\\nMalayalam\\nMaltese\\nMaori\\nMarathi\\nMongolian\\nMyanmar (Burmese)\\nNepali\\nNorwegian\\nOdia (Oriya)\\nPashto\\nPersian\\nPolish\\nPortuguese\\nPunjabi\\nRomanian\\nRussian\\nSamoan\\nScots Gaelic\\nSerbian\\nSesotho\\nShona\\nSindhi\\nSinhala\\nSlovak\\nSlovenian\\nSomali\\nSpanish\\nSundanese\\nSwahili\\nSwedish\\nTajik\\nTamil\\nTatar\\nTelugu\\nThai\\nTurkish\\nTurkmen\\nUkrainian\\nUrdu\\nUyghur\\nUzbek\\nVietnamese\\nWelsh\\nXhosa\\nYiddish\\nYoruba\\nZulu\\nPowered by Translate\\nRECENT POSTS\\nFlowers for Algernon (Radio Play by Bert Coules)\\nThe Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho\\nSambal Without Anchovies by Chua Kok Yee\\nThieving Daughter by Chua Kok Yee\\nTurning Thirty by Minfong Ho\\n72,763 HITS\\nSUBSCRIBE TO BLOG VIA EMAIL\\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\\nJoin 13 other followers\\nSUBSCRIBE\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\nFollow\\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.

I was eight years old.\\nWith field guides all around us, we thumbed through plates of photographs, identifying each shell. Mimi would read the descriptions out loud to be certain our classifications were correct. Then, with a blue ball-point pen, we would write the appropriate name on white adhesive tape and stick it on the corresponding shell.\\n“It’s important to have a hobby,” Mimi said, “something to possess you in your private hours.”\\nMy grandmother’s hobby was spending time at the ocean, walking along the beach, picking up shells.\\nFor a desert child, there was nothing more beautiful than shells. I loved their shapes, their colors. I cherished the way they felt in the palm of my hand – and they held the voice of the sea, a primal sound imprinted on me as a baby.\\n“Your mother and I took you to the beach shortly after you were born,” Mimi said. “As you got older, you played in the sand by the hour.”\\nI played with these shells in the bathtub. The pufferfish was my favorite animal. I knew it was dead, dried out, and hollow, but somehow when it floated in the hot water next to my small, pink body, it came to life – a spiny globe with eyes.\\nMimi would knock on the bathroom door.\\n“Come in,” I would say.\\nShe surveyed my watery world. I handed her the puffer, wet.\\n“When I die,” she said smiling, “these shells will be your inheritance.”\\nThirty years later, these shells—the same shells my grandmother collected on her solitary walks along the beach, the shells we spread out on the turquoise carpet of her study, the shells we catalogued, the shells I bathed with—now rest in a basket on a shelf in my study. They remind me of my natural history, that I was tutored by a woman who courted solitude and made pilgrimages to the edges of our continent in the name of her own pleasure, that beauty, awe, and curiosity were values illuminated in our own home.\\nMy grandmother’s contemplation of shells has become my own. Each shell is a whorl1 of creative expression, an architecture of a soul.

Smith. Yet his faith in modern shipbuilding died with him, as did\\nmost of his 2,228 passengers and crew, when the unimaginable happened.\\nSince Titanic’s discovery there have been a total of seven expeditions to the wreck in manned submersibles. On some of those missions, groups of international scientists have accompanied the salvagers and photographers to study the ship’s structure, disintegration, and metals as well as her deep-ocean environment in hopes of solving some of Titanic’s enduring mysteries. They’ve made some startling discoveries.\\nAt the time of Titanic’s sinking, it was widely held that she had suffered a 300-foot gash in her starboard side that opened her up to massive flooding. During testimony after the tragedy, naval architect Edward Wilding from Harland & Wolff, Titanic’s builders, speculated that a more likely scenario was that several of the ship’s 16 “watertight” compartments had suffered small but significant individual damage, which allowed water to fill them at different rates, thus keeping the ship afloat for two and a half hours.\\nBecause much of Titanic’s bow section is buried in mud, Bob Ballard1 and his team could not see where most iceberg damage would have been. They did, however, see some separations along steel hull plates where rivets had popped free, perhaps on impact with the ice.\\n(4) When the French submersible Nautile visited the wreck in 1996, she held acoustic2 equipment that allowed scientists to “see through the mud” covering the bow. They saw six thin slits, some no wider than a finger, at different points along the hull. Naval architects, again from Harland & Wolff, had earlier used a computer model to learn what kind of flooding such openings below the waterline could have caused had they resulted from hitting the iceberg. They determined that pressure could have forced water into the hull at a rate of nearly seven tons a second, fast enough to sink the bow after about two hours.\\n    Page 17\\nHigh School Language Arts 2008 - copy for Guest LA : HS\\n  Researchers have also been studying metal samples and rivets retrieved from the wreck. Some steel from that time was higher in sulfur and phosphorus than is common today, and it fractured easily in extremely cold temperatures. The temperature in the North Atlantic on Titanic’s fateful night was near freezing, cold enough to have made the metal brittle. In addition, a few of the ship’s wrought-iron rivets were found to have a high slag3 content as well as structural imperfections that may have caused them to unzip along hull seams. Finally, computer analysis shows that as the bow sank and the stern began to rise, the stress on the ship’s midsection was more than 50 percent greater than Titanic was designed to bear. This combination of stress, cold, and structural imperfections may have caused the ship to snap apart like shattering glass.\\n(6) Such technical analyses are enlightening. But it is the eyewitness accounts that most strongly convey the human tragedy of the ship’s final moments. Wrote survivor Jack Thayer: “We could see groups of the almost fifteen hundred people still aboard, clinging in clusters or bunches, like swarming bees; only to fall in masses, pairs or singly, as the great after part of the ship . . . rose into the sky. . . . Gradually she turned her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle.” The “long continuous wailing chant” of those left adrift in the icy sea eventually faded away.\\nWhat’s next for Titanic? Her salvage and the controversy surrounding it will continue. One company is seeking the right to lead sightseeing tours to the wreck. Iron-eating bacteria are devouring her hull. Yet one fact remains uncontested: Titanic continues to hold the hearts and minds of people around the world.\\n__________________________________________________\\n1Bob Ballard: founder and head of the Institute\\nfor Exploration, specializing in deep-ocean archaeology\\n2acoustic: of or pertaining to sound\\n3slag: rough, hard waste material left after metal is\\nseparated from ore by melting\\n“Titanic’s Tempestuous Afterlife” by Lisa Moore LaRoe from Titanic: Collector’s Edition, copyright © 1998 by National Geographic Society.

As Saeng walks home after failing her\\ndriver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to\\na florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased.\\nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.\\n“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner.\\nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1\\n“Saebba,” Saeng whispered.\\nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket.\\nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.\\nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel.\\n    Page 21\\nHigh School Language Arts 2008 - copy for Guest LA : HS\\n  And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs.\\nAnd that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it. “Dok Malik,” she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, “jasmine.”\\nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine- toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it.\\nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?\\nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.\\nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.\\nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her.\\nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully. “Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you -?” Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind.\\nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where did you get it?”\\n“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question.\\n“How much?”\\nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins.\\n“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags2 . . . .”\\n“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said.\\n“Then what else -?”\\n“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.”\\n(24) “You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we -” She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.\\n“What happened?” she asked, more gently.\\n“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said.\\n    Page 22\\nHigh School Language Arts 2008 - copy for Guest LA : HS\\n  For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits.\\nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.”\\n“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. “I mean, not like the kind we had at- at-” She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said.\\n“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matters.”\\nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.”\\nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply.\\n“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her.\\nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?”\\n“I’d love it,” Saeng said.\\nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered— none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac.\\nThe “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes— familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.

NEWMAN APRIL 5, 2016 COMPASSION\\nbzanchi/Dollar Photo Club\\nAs virtues go, patience is a quiet one.\\nIt’s often exhibited behind closed doors, not on a public stage: A father telling a third bedtime story to his son, a dancer waiting for her injury to heal. In public, it’s the impatient ones who grab all our attention: drivers honking in traffic, grumbling customers in slow-moving lines. We have epic movies exalting the virtues of courage and compassion, but a movie about patience might be a bit of a snoozer.\\nHaving patience means being able to wait calmly in the face of frustration or adversity, so anywhere there is frustration or adversity—i.e., nearly everywhere—we have the opportunity to practice it.\\nYet patience is essential to daily life—and might be key to a happy one. Having patience means being able to wait calmly in the face of frustration or adversity, so anywhere there is frustration or adversity—i.e., nearly everywhere—we have the opportunity to practice it. At home with our kids, at work with our colleagues, at the grocery store with half our city’s population, patience can make the difference between annoyance and equanimity, between worry and tranquility.\\nReligions and philosophers have long praised the virtue of patience; now researchers are starting to do so as well. Recent studies have found that, sure enough, good things really do come to those who wait. Some of these science-backed benefits are detailed below, along with three ways to cultivate more patience in your life.\\n1. Patient people enjoy better mental health\\nThis finding is probably easy to believe if you call to mind the stereotypical impatient person: face red, head steaming. And sure enough, according to a 2007 study by Fuller Theological Seminary professor Sarah A. Schnitker and UC Davis psychology professor Robert Emmons, patient people tend to experience less depression and negative emotions, perhaps because they can cope better with upsetting or stressful situations. They also rate themselves as more mindful and feel more gratitude, more connection to mankind and to the universe, and a greater sense of abundance.\\nIn 2012, Schnitker sought to refine our understanding of patience, recognizing that it comes in many different stripes. One type is interpersonal patience, which doesn’t involve waiting but simply facing annoying people with equanimity. In a study of nearly 400 undergraduates, she found that those who are more patient toward others also tend to be more hopeful and more satisfied with their lives.\\nAnother type of patience involves waiting out life’s hardships without frustration or despair—think of the unemployed person who persistently fills out job applications or the cancer patient waiting for her treatment to work. Unsurprisingly, in Schnitker’s study, this type of courageous patience was linked to more hope.\\nFinally, patience over daily hassles—traffic jams, long lines at the grocery store, a malfunctioning computer—seems to go along with good mental health. In particular, people who have this type of patience are more satisfied with life and less depressed.\\nThese studies are good news for people who are already patient, but what about those of us who want to become more patient? In her 2012 study, Schnitker invited 71 undergraduates to participate in two weeks of patience training, where they learned to identify feelings and their triggers, regulate their emotions, empathize with others, and meditate. In two weeks, participants reported feeling more patient toward the trying people in their lives, feeling less depressed, and experiencing higher levels of positive emotions. In other words, patience seems to be a skill you can practice—more on that below—and doing so might bring benefits to your mental health.\\n2. Patient people are better friends and neighbors\\nIn relationships with others, patience becomes a form of kindness. Think of the best friend who comforts you night after night over the heartache that just won’t go away, or the grandchild who smiles through the story she has heard her grandfather tell countless times. Indeed, research suggests that patient people tend to be more cooperative, more empathic, more equitable, and more forgiving. “Patience involves emphatically assuming some personal discomfort to alleviate the suffering of those around us,” write Debra R. Comer and Leslie E. Sekerka in their 2014 study.\\nEvidence of this is found in a 2008 study that put participants into groups of four and asked them to contribute money to a common pot, which would be doubled and redistributed. The game gave players a financial incentive to be stingy, yet patient people contributed more to the pot than other players did.\\nThis kind of selflessness is found among people with all three types of patience mentioned above, not just interpersonal patience: In Schnitker’s 2012 study, all three were associated with higher “agreeableness,” a personality trait characterized by warmth, kindness, and cooperation. The interpersonally patient people even tended to be less lonely, perhaps because making and keeping friends—with all their quirks and slip-ups—generally requires a healthy dose of patience. “Patience may enable individuals to tolerate flaws in others, therefore displaying more generosity, compassion, mercy, and forgiveness,” write Schnitker and Emmons in their 2007 study.\\nOn a group level, patience may be one of the foundations of civil society. Patient people are more likely to vote, an activity that entails waiting months or years for our elected official to implement better policies. Evolutionary theorists believe that patience helped our ancestors survive because it allowed them to do good deeds and wait for others to reciprocate, instead of demanding immediate compensation (which would more likely lead to conflict than cooperation). In that same vein, patience is linked to trust in the people and the institutions around us.\\n3. Patience helps us achieve our goals\\nThe road to achievement is a long one, and those without patience—who want to see results immediately—may not be willing to walk it. Think of the recent critiques of millennials for being unwilling to “pay their dues” in an entry-level job, jumping from position to position rather than growing and learning.\\nIn her 2012 study, Schnitker also examined whether patience helps students get things done. In five surveys they completed over the course of a semester, patient people of all stripes reported exerting more effort toward their goals than other people did. Those with interpersonal patience in particular made more progress toward their goals and were more satisfied when they achieved them (particularly if those goals were difficult) compared with less patient people. According to Schnitker’s analysis, that greater satisfaction with achieving their goals explained why these patient achievers were more content with their lives as a whole.\\n4. Patience is linked to good health\\nThe study of patience is still new, but there’s some emerging evidence that it might even be good for our health. In their 2007 study, Schnitker and Emmons found that patient people were less likely to report health problems like headaches, acne flair-ups, ulcers, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Other research has found that people who exhibit impatience and irritability—a characteristic of the Type A personality—tend to have more health complaints and worse sleep. If patience can reduce our daily stress, it’s reasonable to speculate that it could also protect us against stress’s damaging health effects.\\nThree ways to cultivate patience\\nThis is all good news for the naturally patient—or for those who have the time and opportunity to take an intensive two-week training in patience. But what about the rest of us?\\nIt seems there are everyday ways to build patience as well. Here are some strategies suggested by emerging patience research.\\nReframe the situation. Feeling impatient is not just an automatic emotional response; it involves conscious thoughts and beliefs, too. If a colleague is late to a meeting, you can fume about their lack of respect, or see those extra 15 minutes as an opportunity to get some reading done. Patience is linked to self-control, and consciously trying to regulate our emotions can help us train our self-control muscles.\\nPractice mindfulness. In one study, kids who did a six-month mindfulness program in school became less impulsive and more willing to wait for a reward. The GGSC’s Christine Carter also recommends mindfulness practice for parents: Taking a deep breath and noticing your feelings of anger or overwhelm (for example, when your kids start yet another argument right before bedtime) can help you respond with more patience.\\nPractice gratitude. In another study, adults who were feeling grateful were also better at patiently delaying gratification. When given the choice between getting an immediate cash reward or waiting a year for a larger ($100) windfall, less grateful people caved in once the immediate payment offer climbed to $18. Grateful people, however, could hold out until the amount reached $30. If we’re thankful for what we have today, we’re not desperate for more stuff or better circumstances immediately.\\nWe can try to shelter ourselves from frustration and adversity, but they come with the territory of being human. Practicing patience in everyday situations—like with our punctuality-challenged coworker—will not only make life more pleasant in the present, but might also help pave the way for a more satisfying and successful future.\\nThis article originally appeared on Greater Good, the online magazine of UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, one of Mindful’s partners.

You\\'re already late, you can feel your body getting tense, and you\\'re starting to get angry. Suddenly, you lose your temper and yell at the person for putting you behind schedule. You can tell that they\\'re shocked and upset by your outburst, but you can\\'t help it.\\nWe likely all lose our patience occasionally. But doing so frequently or inappropriately can harm your reputation, damage your relationships, increase stress, or escalate a difficult situation.\\nDiscover a range of strategies to help you to stay calm and patient.\\nIn this article, we explore different kinds of patience and how they apply in the workplace. We also examine the strategies that you can use to develop and nurture this essential quality.\\nWhat Is Patience?\\nPatience is the ability to stay calm while you\\'re waiting for an outcome that you need or want. According to research by psychologist Sarah Schnitker, it comes in three main varieties: interpersonal patience, life hardship patience, and daily hassles patience.\\nLet\\'s look at these in more detail:\\n1. Interpersonal Patience\\nInterpersonal patience is patience with other people, their demands and their failings.\\nYou may consider some people to be slow learners, hard to understand, or even downright unreasonable. Or, they may have bad habits that drive you crazy. But losing your patience with them will be of no benefit, and it may make matters worse.\\nPatience and understanding toward others is essential when you\\'re onboarding new staff, or when you\\'re delegating tasks. It\\'s also a huge help in dealing with difficult co-workers or managers, and it\\'s central to high-quality customer service.\\nThis type of patience is active. Listening skills and empathy   are vital, and, when you\\'re dealing with difficult people   , you need the self-awareness   and emotional intelligence   to understand how your words and actions affect the situation. You can\\'t just wait it out and hope for the best.\\n2. Life Hardship Patience\\nWe could use the term perseverance to sum up life hardship patience. It can mean having the patience to overcome a serious setback in life, like waiting long term for the outcome of a lawsuit, or for medical treatment. But it can also include your ability to work toward a long-term goal – whether it\\'s professional, such as a promotion, or personal, like getting fit or saving for a vacation.\\nWhatever the obstacle you have to overcome, it will likely require determination and focus   to achieve. And you will need to keep your emotions under control throughout the journey. These emotions can range from eagerness to get it done, to anger at the frustrations you encounter along the way – which can cause you to become demotivated.\\n3. Daily Hassles Patience\\nSometimes you need patience to deal with circumstances that are beyond your control. These are your \"life hassles.\" Something as trivial as getting stuck in a traffic line, for instance, or waiting for a computer program to load.\\nYou also need patience to get through those dull but unavoidable day-to-day tasks that don\\'t necessarily contribute to your personal goals. The ability to maintain self-discipline   , and give a job – no matter how mundane – the attention to detail it needs, is a hallmark of patience.\\nResearch suggests that people who can stay calm in the face of these constant, petty frustrations are more likely to be more empathic, more equitable, and to suffer less from depression.\\nThe Benefits and Risks of Patience\\nIn general, being patient means that you\\'re more likely viewed positively by your co-workers and managers (and your family and friends). You\\'ll likely be a better team worker, and more focused and productive.\\nIf you\\'re often impatient, people may see you as arrogant, insensitive and impulsive. Co-workers may think that you\\'re a poor decision maker, because you make snap judgments or interrupt people. If you get a reputation for having poor people skills and a bad temper, others may even deliberately avoid working with you. As a result, not surprisingly, impatient people will unlikely be top of the list for promotion.\\nOf course, being patient doesn\\'t mean you should be a \"pushover.\" Far from it. Sometimes it\\'s OK to show your displeasure when people keep you waiting unnecessarily. So, ensure that you establish strong boundaries   . But, be sure that you\\'re polite and assertive   , never angry and aggressive.\\nThe key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it open.\\n– Arnold Glasow, American humorist.\\nUnderstanding Impatience\\nImpatience has its roots in frustration. It\\'s a feeling of rising stress that starts when you feel that your needs and wishes are being ignored. In a modern environment where we\\'re accustomed to instant communication and immediate access to data, it\\'s a growing problem. But recognizing the warning signs can help you to prevent impatience from taking hold.\\nImpatience Symptoms\\nImpatience has a range of symptoms. Physical signs can include shallow, fast breathing, muscle tension, and hand clenching. Or you may find yourself restlessly jiggling your feet.\\nThere may be changes in your mood and thoughts, too. You may become irritable, angry, or experience anxiety or nervousness. Rushing to do things and making snap decisions – the symptoms of hurry sickness   – are clear signs that your impatience is gaining the upper hand.\\nImpatience Triggers\\nIf you experience these feelings and symptoms, try to identify what has caused them. Many of us have \"triggers\" for impatience. These could be specific people, words or situations.\\nMake a list of things that cause you to become impatient. If you\\'re having trouble identifying your triggers, stop and think about the last time you felt this way. What caused it?\\nIf you\\'re not sure, ask your co-workers (or your friends and family) about your impatience. Chances are, they know what gets you \"wound up.\" The 5 Whys   technique can also aid you in identifying the root cause of an issue.\\nTry keeping a journal   to record when you start to feel impatient. Write down the details of the situation, and why you\\'re getting frustrated. This can help you to examine your actions and to understand why you respond in this way.\\nYou won\\'t always be able to avoid the triggers that make you impatient. But you can learn to manage your reactions to them.\\nTip:\\nMany people become impatient due to physical factors such as hunger, dehydration or fatigue   . Bear this in mind the next time you start to feel impatient. A simple remedy might be a snack and a glass of water!\\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\\nReceive new career skills every week, plus get our latest offers and a free downloadable Personal Development Plan workbook.\\nRead our Privacy Policy\\nManaging the Symptoms of Impatience\\nWhen you feel impatient, it\\'s important to get out of this damaging frame of mind as quickly as possible. Try to develop strategies to deal with your impatience as you notice it.\\nManaging Physical Symptoms\\nTake deep, slow breaths, and count to 10. Doing this will slow your heart rate, relax your body, and distance you emotionally from the situation. Sometimes you might need a longer count, or to repeat the process several times.\\nImpatience can cause you to tense your muscles involuntarily. So, consciously focus on relaxing your body   . Again, take slow, deep breaths. Relax your muscles, from your toes up to the top of your head.\\nForce yourself to slow down. Make yourself speak and move more slowly. It will appear to others as if you\\'re calm – and acting patient often makes you feel more patient.\\nEmotional Symptoms\\nRemember, you do have a choice about how you react to certain situations. You can choose to be patient, or not: it\\'s up to you. (Read our article, Managing Your Emotions at Work   , to learn more about this.)\\nChallenge your negative assumptions, instead of letting your impatience build. Aim to reframe the circumstances in a more positive light. For example, people might not mind if a meeting is delayed, as long as you let them know in advance that you\\'re running late. There may even be benefits to the delay: understanding a developing situation more clearly, for example.\\nWarning:\\nUncharacteristic displays of impatience may be a sign of underlying problems such as stress   , exhaustion or burnout   . If you think this may apply to you, seek advice from a qualified health professional.\\nBeing Patient With Other People\\nIf your impatience causes you to react angrily toward others, read our article on Anger Management   to learn how to control this powerful emotion.\\nPracticing empathy   can also enable you to defuse your impatience. Give the other person your full attention, and try to see beyond your own frustrations by imagining yourself in the other person\\'s position.\\nRemind yourself that impatience rarely has a positive effect – in fact, it may even interfere with the person\\'s ability to perform. Impatience will likely generate more conflict and stress, which will be counterproductive.\\nAlthough some people are naturally patient, the rest of us need to practice, for it to become a habit. Becoming more patient won\\'t happen overnight, but persistence can pay off!\\nKey Points\\nPatience is a vital quality in the workplace. It can reduce stress and conflict, lead to better working relationships, and help you to achieve your long-term life and career goals.\\nMany of us struggle with impatience. Learn to recognize the physical and emotional symptoms associated with it, and to identify the situations that trigger it.\\nWhen you understand the causes of your impatience, you can develop strategies to prevent or overcome it. These could include attending to your physical well-being by using deep breathing and relaxation techniques, and developing your empathy and emotional intelligence skills.\\nThis site teaches you the skills you need for a happy and successful career; and this is just one of many tools and resources that you\\'ll find here at Mind Tools.

It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled,[1] or from humorous stories or thoughts.[2] Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators[3] as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation. Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling.\\nLaughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations. Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others. Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback.[4][5][6][7]\\nThe study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology.\\nLaughter\\nA short clip of a woman laughing.\\nProblems playing this file?

It may ensue from jokes, tickling, and other stimuli completely unrelated to psychological state, such as nitrous oxide. One group of researchers speculated that noises from infants as early as 16 days old may be vocal laughing sounds or laughter,[8] however the weight of the evidence supports its appearance at 15 weeks to four months of age.\\nLaughter researcher Robert Provine [es] said: \"Laughter is a mechanism everyone has; laughter is part of universal human vocabulary. There are thousands of languages, hundreds of thousands of dialects, but everyone speaks laughter in pretty much the same way.\" Babies have the ability to laugh before they ever speak. Children who are born blind and deaf still retain the ability to laugh.[9]\\nProvine argues that \"Laughter is primitive, an unconscious vocalization.\" Provine argues that it probably is genetic. In a study of the \"Giggle Twins\", two happy twins who were separated at birth and only reunited 43 years later, Provine reports that \"until they met each other, neither of these exceptionally happy ladies had known anyone who laughed as much as they did.\" They reported this even though they had been brought together by their adoptive parents, who they indicated were \"undemonstrative and dour\". He indicates that the twins \"inherited some aspects of their laugh sound and pattern, readiness to laugh, and maybe even taste in humor\".[10]\\nScientists have noted the similarity in forms of laughter induced by tickling among various primates, which suggests that laughter derives from a common origin among primate species.[11][12]\\nA very rare neurological condition has been observed whereby the sufferer is unable to laugh out loud, a condition known as aphonogelia.[13]\\nBrain[edit]\\nA woman laughing\\nA man laughing\\nNeurophysiology indicates that laughter is linked with the activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, that produces endorphins.[14] Scientists have shown that parts of the limbic system are involved in laughter. This system is involved in emotions and helps us with functions necessary for humans\\' survival. The structures in the limbic system that are involved in laughter are the hippocampus and the amygdala.[15]\\nThe December 7, 1984, Journal of the American Medical Association describes the neurological causes of laughter as follows:\\n\"Although there is no known \\'laugh center\\' in the brain, its neural mechanism has been the subject of much, albeit inconclusive, speculation. It is evident that its expression depends on neural paths arising in close association with the telencephalic and diencephalic centers concerned with respiration. Wilson considered the mechanism to be in the region of the mesial thalamus, hypothalamus, and subthalamus. Kelly and co-workers, in turn, postulated that the tegmentum near the periaqueductal grey contains the integrating mechanism for emotional expression. Thus, supranuclear pathways, including those from the limbic system that Papez hypothesised to mediate emotional expressions such as laughter, probably come into synaptic relation in the reticular core of the brain stem. So while purely emotional responses such as laughter are mediated by subcortical structures, especially the hypothalamus, and are stereotyped, the cerebral cortex can modulate or suppress them.\"\\nSome drugs are well known for their laughter-facilitating properties (e. g. ethanol and cannabis),[16] while the others, like salvinorin A (the active ingredient of Salvia divinorum), can even induce bursts of uncontrollable laughter.[17]\\nA research article was published December 1, 2000 on the psycho-evolution of laughter (Panksepp 2000).[18]\\nHealth[edit]\\nA link between laughter and healthy function of blood vessels was first reported in 2005 by researchers at the University of Maryland Medical Center with the fact that laughter causes the dilatation of the inner lining of blood vessels, the endothelium, and increases blood flow.[19] Drs. Michael Miller (University of Maryland) and William Fry (Stanford) theorize that beta-endorphin like compounds released by the hypothalamus activate receptors on the endothelial surface to release nitric oxide, thereby resulting in dilation of vessels. Other cardioprotective properties of nitric oxide include reduction of inflammation and decreased platelet aggregation.[20]\\nLaughter has proven beneficial effects on various other aspects of biochemistry. It has been shown to lead to reductions in stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine. When laughing the brain also releases endorphins that can relieve some physical pain.[21] Laughter also boosts the number of antibody-producing cells and enhances the effectiveness of T-cells, leading to a stronger immune system.[22] A 2000 study found that people with heart disease were 40 percent less likely to laugh and be able to recognize humor in a variety of situations, compared to people of the same age without heart disease.[23]\\nAnecdotally, journalist and author Norman Cousins developed in 1964 a treatment program for his ankylosing spondylitis and collagen disease consisting of large doses of Vitamin C alongside laughter induced by comic films, including those of the Marx Brothers. \"I made the joyous discovery that ten minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep,\" he reported. \"When the pain-killing effect of the laughter wore off, we would switch on the motion picture projector again and not infrequently, it would lead to another pain-free interval.\"[24][25]\\nCommunication[edit]\\nA number of studies using methods of conversation analysis and discourse analysis have documented the systematic workings of laughter in a variety of interactions, from casual conversations to interviews, meetings, and therapy sessions.[26] Working with recorded interactions, researchers have created detailed transcripts that indicate not only the presence of laughter but also features of its production and placement.\\nThese studies challenge several widely held assumptions about the nature of laughter. Contrary to notions that it is spontaneous and involuntary, research documents that laughter is sequentially organized and precisely placed relative to surrounding talk. Far more than merely a response to humor, laughter often works to manage delicate and serious moments. More than simply an external behavior “caused” by an inner state, laughter is highly communicative and helps accomplish actions and regulate relationships.[27]\\nCauses[edit]\\nLaughter is a common response to tickling\\nSee also: Theories of humor\\nCommon causes for laughter are sensations of joy and humor; however, other situations may cause laughter as well.\\nA general theory that explains laughter is called the relief theory. Sigmund Freud summarized it in his theory that laughter releases tension and \"psychic energy\". This theory is one of the justifications of the beliefs that laughter is beneficial for one\\'s health.[28] This theory explains why laughter can be used as a coping mechanism when one is upset, angry or sad.\\nPhilosopher John Morreall theorizes that human laughter may have its biological origins as a kind of shared expression of relief at the passing of danger. Friedrich Nietzsche, by contrast, suggested laughter to be a reaction to the sense of existential loneliness and mortality that only humans feel.\\nFor example: a joke creates an inconsistency and the audience automatically tries to understand what the inconsistency means; if they are successful in solving this \\'cognitive riddle\\' and they realize that the surprise was not dangerous, they laugh with relief. Otherwise, if the inconsistency is not resolved, there is no laugh, as Mack Sennett pointed out: \"when the audience is confused, it doesn\\'t laugh.\" This is one of the basic laws of a comedian, referred to as \"exactness\". It is important to note that sometimes the inconsistency may be resolved and there may still be no laugh.[citation needed] Because laughter is a social mechanism, an audience may not feel as if they are in danger, and the laugh may not occur. In addition, the extent of the inconsistency (and aspects of its timing and rhythm) has to do with the amount of danger the audience feels, and how hard or long they laugh.\\nLaughter can also be brought on by tickling. Although most people find it unpleasant, being tickled often causes heavy laughter, thought to be an (often uncontrollable) reflex of the body.[29][30]\\nTwo laughing men by Hans von Aachen, circa 1574\\nStructure and anatomy[edit]\\nA normal laugh has the structure of \"ha-ha-ha\" or \"ho-ho-ho\". It is unnatural, and one is physically unable, to have a laugh structure of \"ha-ho-ha-ho\". The usual variations of a laugh most often occur in the first or final note in a sequence- therefore, \"ho-ha-ha\" or \"ha-ha-ho\" laughs are possible. Normal note durations with unusually long or short \"inter-note intervals\" do not happen due to the result of the limitations of our vocal cords. This basic structure allows one to recognize a laugh despite individual variants.[31]\\nIt has also been determined that eyes moisten during laughter as a reflex from the tear glands.[22]\\nNegative aspects[edit]\\nLaughter is not always a pleasant experience and is associated with several negative phenomena. Excessive laughter can lead to cataplexy, and unpleasant laughter spells, excessive elation, and fits of laughter can all be considered negative aspects of laughter. Unpleasant laughter spells, or \"sham mirth,\" usually occur in people who have a neurological condition, including patients with pseudobulbar palsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\\'s disease. These patients appear to be laughing out of amusement but report that they are feeling undesirable sensations \"at the time of the punch line\".\\nExcessive elation is a common symptom associated with bipolar disorder psychoses and mania/hypomania. Those who suffer from schizophrenic psychoses seem to suffer the opposite—they do not understand humor or get any joy out of it. A fit describes an abnormal time when one cannot control the laughter or one\\'s body, sometimes leading to seizures or a brief period of unconsciousness. Some believe that fits of laughter represent a form of epilepsy.[32]\\nTherapy[edit]\\nLaughter has been used as a therapeutic tool for many years because it is a natural form of medicine. Laughter is available to everyone and it provides benefits to a person\\'s physical, emotional, and social well being. Some of the benefits of using laughter therapy are that it can relieve stress and relax the whole body.[33] It can also boost the immune system and release endorphins to relieve pain.[34] Additionally, laughter can help prevent heart disease by increasing blood flow and improving the function of blood vessels.[35] Some of the emotional benefits include diminishing anxiety or fear, improving overall mood, and adding joy to one\\'s life. Laughter is also known to reduce allergic reactions in a preliminary study related to dust mite allergy sufferers.[36]\\nLaughter therapy also has some social benefits, such as strengthening relationships, improving teamwork and reducing conflicts, and making oneself more attractive to others. Therefore, whether a person is trying to cope with a terminal illness or just trying to manage their stress or anxiety levels, laughter therapy can be a significant enhancement to their life.[37][38]\\nRamon Mora-Ripoll in his study on The Therapeutic Value Of Laughter In Medicine, stated that laughter therapy is an inexpensive and simple tool that can be used in patient care.[39] It is a tool that is only beneficial when experienced and shared. Care givers need to recognize the importance of laughter and possess the right attitude to pass it on. He went on to say that since this type of therapy is not widely practiced, health care providers will have to learn how to effectively use it. In another survey, researchers looked at how Occupational Therapists and other care givers viewed and used humor with patients as a means of therapy.[40] Many agreed that while they believed it was beneficial to the patients, the proper training was lacking in order to effectively use It.[40] Even though laughter and humor has been used therapeutically in medical conditions, according to Mora-Ripoll, there was not enough data to clearly establish that laughter could be used as an overall means of healing. It did suggest that additional research was still needed since \"well-designed randomized controlled trials have not been conducted to date validating the therapeutic efficacy of laughter.\"[39]\\nIn 2017, an institution in Japan conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of laughter therapy on quality of life in patients with cancer.[41] The study used laughter yoga, comedy, clown and jokes. The result showed that laughter therapy was helpful in improving quality of life and cancer symptoms in some areas for cancer survivors. Improvements were seen in the area of depression, anxiety and stress levels. There were limited harmful side effects. Laughter therapy should be used in conjunction with other cancer treatment.[41]\\nResearch and philosophy[edit]\\nMain article: Gelotology\\nLate 19th-century or early 20th-century depiction of different stages of laughter on advertising cards\\nLaughter in literature, although considered understudied by some,[42] is a subject that has received attention in the written word for millennia. The use of humor and laughter in literary works has been studied and analyzed by many thinkers and writers, from the Ancient Greek philosophers onward. Henri Bergson\\'s Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic (Le rire, 1901) is a notable 20th-century contribution.\\nAncient[edit]\\nHerodotus[edit]\\nFor Herodotus, laughers can be distinguished into three types:[43]\\nThose who are innocent of wrongdoing, but ignorant of their own vulnerability\\nThose who are mad\\nThose who are overconfident\\nAccording to Donald Lateiner, Herodotus reports about laughter for valid literary and historiological reasons. \"Herodotus believes either that both nature (better, the gods\\' direction of it) and human nature coincide sufficiently, or that the latter is but an aspect or analogue of the former, so that to the recipient the outcome is suggested.\"[43] When reporting laughter, Herodotus does so in the conviction that it tells the reader something about the future and/or the character of the person laughing. It is also in this sense that it is not coincidental that in about 80% of the times when Herodotus speaks about laughter it is followed by a retribution. \"Men whose laughter deserves report are marked, because laughter connotes scornful disdain, disdain feeling of superiority, and this feeling and the actions which stem from it attract the wrath of the gods.\"[43]\\nModern[edit]\\nSee also: Theories of humor\\nComedian Harold Lloyd laughing.\\nThere is a wide range of experiences with laughter. A 1999 study by two humor researchers asked 80 people to keep a daily laughter record, and found they laughed an average of 18 times per day. However, their study also found a wide range, with some people laughing as many as 89 times per day, and others laughing as few as 0 times per day.[44]\\nHobbes[edit]\\nThomas Hobbes wrote, \"The passion of laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison with the infirmity of others, or with our own formerly.\"[citation needed]\\nSchopenhauer[edit]\\nPhilosopher Arthur Schopenhauer devotes the 13th chapter of the first part of his major work, The World as Will and Representation, to laughter.\\nNietzsche[edit]\\nFriedrich Nietzsche distinguishes two different purposes for the use of laughter. In a positive sense, \"man uses the comical as a therapy against the restraining jacket of logic, morality and reason. He needs from time to time a harmless demotion from reason and hardship and in this sense laughter has a positive character for Nietzsche.\"[45] Laughter can, however, also have a negative connotation when it is used for the expression of social conflict. This is expressed, for instance, in The Gay Science : \"Laughter -- Laughter means to be schadenfroh, but with clear conscience.\"[46]\\n\"Possibly Nietzsche\\'s works would have had a totally different effect, if the playful, ironical and joking in his writings would have been factored in better\"[47]\\nBergson[edit]\\nIn Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic, French philosopher Henri Bergson, renowned for his philosophical studies on materiality, memory, life and consciousness, tries to determine the laws of the comic and to understand the fundamental causes of comic situations.[48] His method consists in determining the causes of the comic instead of analyzing its effects. He also deals with laughter in relation to human life, collective imagination and art, to have a better knowledge of society.[49] One of the theories of the essay is that laughter, as a collective activity, has a social and moral role, in forcing people to eliminate their vices. It is a factor of uniformity of behaviours, as it condemns ludicrous and eccentric behaviours.[50]\\nLudovici[edit]\\nAnthony Ludovici developed the thoughts of Hobbes even further in The Secret of Laughter. His conviction is that there\\'s something sinister in laughter, and that the modern omnipresence of humour and the idolatry of it are signs of societal weakness, as instinctive resort to humour became a sort of escapism from responsibility and action. Ludovici considered laughter to be an evolutionary trait and he offered many examples of different triggers for laughter with their own distinct explanations.[51]\\nSee also[edit]\\nDeath from laughter\\nEvil laughter\\nGelotology\\nLaughter in animals\\nLaughter yoga\\nNervous laughter\\nParadoxical laughter\\nPathological laughing and crying\\nReferences[edit]\\n^ Stearns, Frederic Rudolph (1972).

Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo, Listen to it carefully: it is not an articulate, clear, well-defined sound; it is something which would fain be prolonged by reverberating from one to another, something beginning with a crash, to continue in successive rumblings, like thunder in a mountain. Still, this reverberation cannot go on for ever. It can travel within as wide a circle as you please: the circle remains, none the less, a closed one.\\n^ Kawakami, Kiyobumi; Takai-Kawakami, Kiyoko; Tomonaga, Masaki; Suzuki, Juri; Kusaka, Tomiyo; Okai, Takashi (2006). \"Origins of smile and laughter: A preliminary study\" (PDF).
